The participles in @[tvā] and @[am]* when repeated yield the sense of repetition of the action or condition expressed by the verb; @[smaratvā smaratvā] or @[smaram smaram]—'having repeatedly remembered'; @[pītvā pītvā] or @[pāyam pāyam] 'having drunk again and again,' similarly @[bhuj-] @[bhuktvā bhuktvā] or @[bhojam bhojam]; @[śru-] @[śrutvā śrutvā] or @[śrāvam śrāvam]. @[gam-] @[gatvā gatvā] or @[gāmam gāmam] or @[gamam gamam], @[labh-] @[labdhvā labdhvā] or @[lābham lābham] or @[labham labham], @[pralam-] @[pralambham pralambham], @[jāgṛ-] @[jāgaram jāgaram],† &c.

† At the end of compounds this may not be repeated and yet have the sense of repetition; as in:
@[nāmnā kakutsthakulajo namavaskandamurmāñchakān | pādodāni ca tāsām rasavismayamāna āste ||] Bhaṭṭi. VII. 11.
The descendant of Kakutstha, smiling gently, repeatedly bending down the creepers would pluck their flowers, wading through every stream (that he came across), would sip the waters, and seating himself on every charming slab would remain there (in admiration of the scenery).
