The words @[ṛc], @[pur], @[saras], @[yuga] when it does not mean 'the yoke of a carriage', and @[pathin], † at the end of any compound take the suffix @[ac]; @[ardharcam] 'half a Rik;' @[viṣṇupuram] 'the town of Viṣṇu;' @[vimalāmbu saraḥ] 'a lake with pure water;' @[rājyadhurā] 'the yoke of a kingdom', i. e. 'the heavy responsibilities of governing it' &c. @[ramyapathā deśaḥ] 'a country with pleasant roads', &c.

(a) But in the case of @[ṛc] preceded by @[asu] or @[bahu] the @[a] is added only when the compound denotes a student of the Rig veda§; @[anṛcaḥ] 'one who does not study the Rig veda,' @[bahuṛcaḥ] 'one that has studied the Rig veda;' but @[asṛk sāma], 'the Sāma veda that contains no riks,' @[bahvṛk sūktam] 'a hymn consisting of many riks.'
