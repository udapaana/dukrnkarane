The change of a semi-vowel to its corresponding vowel is called Samprasarana. Samprasarana generally takes place before weak terminations in the case of the following roots—@[vac], @[vad], @[vap], @[vah], @[vas] 'to dwell,' @[svap], @[yaj], @[vaj], @[vadh], @[svap], @[jyā], @[vyadh], @[vye], @[pracch], @[braj], @[bhrasj], @[ah] and @[vyadh]. In the case of the perfect the roots @[vev], @[vraśc] and @[vyadh] form an exception.
