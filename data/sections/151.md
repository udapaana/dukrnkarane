@[antara] is a pronoun (and therefore declined like @[sarva] m. f.) when it means 'exterior, outer; or what is to be worn out-side, as a garment'* except when followed by @[ca]; it is optionally declined like nouns ending in @[a] in the Nom. pl. and Ab. and Loc. sing. of the mas., e.g. @[antare] @[antarā] @[vā] @[śāṭakāḥ]; @[antare-antarā] @[vā] @[śāṭakāḥ] (garments). But @[antarāyām] only.
