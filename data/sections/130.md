## § 130. @deva[मघवन्] ( epithet of @deva[इन्द्र] ) follows the decl. of

§ 130. @deva[मघवन्] ( epithet of @deva[इन्द्र] ) follows the decl. of
@deva[युवन्], but with certain exceptions. Thus the forms of @deva[युवन्] are
allowed to occur throughout its declension ( @deva[युवभ्यवत्मघवा] Kāsikā
on VII. 1. 1 ) ; and, besides these, there are the following
permissible forms viz. @deva[मघवन्], @deva[मघवा], @deva[मघवन्], @deva[मघवानम्], @deva[मघवने] &c.
The affixes of the nom. etc. dual and pl., viz. @deva[औ], @deva[ओस्], @deva[शस्], @deva[भिः]
&c., are to be applied to the end of the base ( @deva[यस्यचतुर्थीयुतन्ता निर्देशः],
Pan. III. 2. 179 ), that is, these affixes are to be added without
dropping the @deva[न्] of @deva[मघवन्], being preceded by the final syllable @deva[वन्]
which is looked upon as an affix for this purpose. That is to
say, @deva[न्] is not to be dropped by the rule @deva[नाम्यपरे] ( Pan. VI. 4. 3 ),
and so we have the forms @deva[मघवन्] + @deva[औ] → @deva[मघवनौ] → @deva[मघोनौ]; so also
@deva[मघोनौ], @deva[मघवन्] + @deva[ओस्] → @deva[मघो]
