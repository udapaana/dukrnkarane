The following suffixes are sometimes added to nominal bases to express the meanings of cases.

(a) The suffix @deva[तस्‌] added to the base of a noun gives it the sense of the Ab.*; as @deva[प्रमादतः], 'from carelessness', @deva[वस्तुतः] 'from the real state of the thing, in reality', @deva[ज्ञानतः] 'from knowledge', @deva[अत्र] &c.

(b) The suffix @deva[त्र] is used to denote the meaning of the Loc.* case, and is generally added to pronominal adjectives; as @deva[अत्र] 'in that place, there'; @deva[सर्वत्र] 'in every place, everywhere', &c.
