But (a) It is not compounded with verbal derivatives ending in @[tṛ] and @[aka] and denoting the agent of the action; @[odasya] @[kartā] and not @[odanakartā]; @[odasya] @[pācakaḥ] &c.; but @[indrasya] @[vajradhara] or @[vajradharaḥ] as the @[aka] here does not denote the agent.

Exception:—But a compound is allowed in the case of the words @[yājaka] one who employs as sacrificing priests, @[pūjaka], @[paricāraka], @[pariṣevaka] a waiter at meals, @[snāpaka] a servant who bathes his master or brings bathing water for him, @[adhyāpaka], @[utsādaka] one who destroys, @[hantṛ], @[dhara], when it does not mean 'a holder,' and others not very important; @[brāhmaṇayājaka], @[devatāpūjaka], @[rājaparicāraka] &c.; @[agnihota], @[hotṛ], &c. as @[vajra] @[dhartā] 'the thunderbolt-bearer'.

(b) A partitive Genitive (i.e. from which a singling out is made) is not compounded with any other word; as @[teṣāṃ] @[dvijaḥ] @[śreṣṭhaḥ].

(c) A noun in the Genitive is not compounded with ordinal numbers, words denoting qualities, words implying satisfaction, present participles, past participles meaning 'honoured or approved of' or showing the place of the act, verbal indeclinables and verbal nouns ending in @[tavya]; e.g. @[satāṃ] @[ṣaṣṭhaḥ], @[brāhmaṇasya] @[guṇaḥ] (@[guṇavān]); @[kākasya] @[kāṇyam]; @[phalānāṃ] @[tṛptaḥ] 'satisfied with fruits' (an Inst. Tat. is, of course, allowed in these cases); @[dvijeṣu] @[kurvat] @[karuṇāṃ] or @[kiṃkaraḥ], @[satāṃ] @[mataḥ] esteemed by the good; @[rājñāṃ] @[pūjitaḥ], @[idam] @[eṣām] @[āsitam] (place of sitting) @[gatam] @[śayitaṃ] or; @[brāhmaṇasya] @[tyāga], @[narasya] @[kartavyam] &c.

N. B. Compounds like @[rājapūjitaḥ], @[rājamatḥ], &c. ought to be considered as Instrumental Tatpurushas.

Exceptions.

(1) If the word denoting a quality ends in @[tara] it does combine with a noun in the Genitive, and the @[tara] is dropped; @[sarveṣāṃ śvetataraḥ sarvaśvetaḥ] whiter than all others; similarly @[sarveṣāṃ mahattaraḥ sarvamahān] &c.

(2)* The words @[dvitīya], @[tṛtīya], @[caturtha] and @[turya] are compounded with nouns signifying the whole of which they are parts, and are optionally placed first; @[dvitīyaṃ bhikṣāyāḥ dvitīyabhikṣā], @[bhikṣādvitīyam] half of the quantity of alms; but @[dvitā bhikṣāyāḥ] (begging alms a second time) @[bhikṣukaḥ].

Note.—Compounds like @[dvitīyabhikṣā], @[pūrvakāyaḥ] (see further on) &c, are not strictly Gen. Tat, as the case of the first word determines the name, but mere Tat.; some call these Nom. Tat. (@[prāthamikatapuruṣa]).

(3)† A noun in the Genitive, used as an object in a sentence, when the agent and object of the action denoted by the nouns formed by @[kit] affixes are both used, is not compounded, as @[āścaryaṃ gavāṃ dohaḥ cāgopena] 'the milking of cows by one, not a cowherd, is a wonder.'
