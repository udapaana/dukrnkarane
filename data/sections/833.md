rule: §833

The principal sense of the Ablative case is @[apādāna] or 'motion away from;' hence the noun from which the motion, real or conceived, takes place is put in the Ablative case; @[grāmād āgacchati] 'comes from a village,' @[dhāvataḥ aśvāt patati] 'falls down from a running horse'; @[sadācalāt patati].

(a) Words having the sense of @[dveṣa], @[virāma] or 'cessation,' 'pause,' and @[pramāda] 'swerving from,' also govern the Ablative case; @[pāpāt dveṣṭi] 'he hates sin' @[na navaḥ phalodayāt sthirakarman virarāma karmaṇaḥ] (Ragh. VIII. 22.) 'the new monarch, steady in action, did not desist from efforts until they bore their fruit'; @[dharmāt pramādyati] 'swerves from duty'; @[svakāryāt pramattaḥ] (Megh. I.) 'careless, failing in the discharge of the duties (of his office)'; so @[dharmān muñcāti]; @[prasamīkṣya nivarteta sarvaprāṇasya māraṇāt] (Manu Smṛ. 6. 49.); &c.

@[pramad] with @[pra] in the sense of 'to be careless about' is used with the Loc. also; @[ataḥ kāraṇāt pramādyanti pramadā vipaścitaḥ] (Manu Smṛ. II. 213.) 'on this account wise men are not careless about their wives.'
