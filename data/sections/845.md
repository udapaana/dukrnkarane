The words @[stoka] 'a little,' @[alpa] 'a little,' @[kaṣṭa] 'difficulty,' and @[katipaya] 'some' when used in an adverbial sense with verbs, are used in the Ablative or the Instrumental; @[stokena] @[stokāt] @[vā] @[muktaḥ] let off with little; similarly @[alpena] @[alpāt] @[vā] @[muktaḥ], @[kaṣṭena] @[kaṣṭāt] @[vā] @[kṛtam] done with difficulty; @[katipayena] @[katipayāt] @[vā] @[prāptaḥ], but @[alpena] @[viṣeṇa] @[hataḥ] killed with a little poison; when used adverbially they take the Accusative also; @[stokaṃ] @[gacchati] goes a little.

(b) @[dūra] and @[antika] and others having the same sense, are used in the Ablative, the Accusative and the Instrumental cases; @[grāmasya] @[dūrāt] @[dūre] @[dūreṇa] @[vā] away from the village; so @[antikāt] @[antikaṃ] @[antikena] @[vā] near the village.
