(a) @[bhū] too if it has a @[subanta] prefixed to it and is without a preposition takes the affix @[kyap] impersonally, @[brahmaṇo bhūyaṃ brahmabhūyam] 'identity with Brāhmaṇa.' When no @[subanta] is used prepositionally with it, it takes the affix @[yat]; @[bhavya] or @[bhūmanya].

(b) @[vac] under similar circumstances takes either @[kyap] or @[ṇyat] in a passive sense or impersonally; @[vedavācyam] or @[vedavākyam] 'expounding the Veda' (@[vedasya vācyaṃ tasya bhāvaḥ] Sid. Kau.).
