§ 181.  In a compound, as a general rule, words are simply
joined together, without any relation between the component
parts being actually expressed ; the whole compound word has
the power to express the various relations that exist between the
several parts.  The last word only takes the case termination
required by its grammatical position in a sentence, the remaining
words ( those ending in a consonant ) generally assuming their
crude forms before the consonantal case terminations ; e. g.
@deva[विद्वस्] + @deva[जनः] = @deva[विद्वज्जनः] ( see below ), @deva[राजन्] + @deva[पुत्रः] = @deva[राजपुत्रः], &c.
