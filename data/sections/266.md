No @[ka] is affixed:

(a) when the whole compound is used as a name or when it ends in @[īyas], as @[viśve devāḥ śreṣṭhāḥ yasya viśvadevaḥ] 'whose deities are the Viśvadevas', @[bahavaḥ bhāryāḥ yasya bahubhāryaḥ]. A Bah. ending in @[īyas] (i.e. comp.) does not shorten its final vowel; e.g. @[bahvyaḥ śreṣṭhāḥ bhāryāḥ yasya bahubhāryasīḥ] 'one having many excellent wives'. But @[atiśreyasīḥ] as a tatpuruṣa.

(b) to the word @[bhrātṛ] preceded by a term of praise, @[prahāsto bhrātā yasya sa prahāstabhrātṛḥ]; but @[jhaṣabhrātṛkaḥ] one whose brother is a fool.

(c) to the words @[nāḍī] and @[tantī] both referring to the body of an animal; @[bahunāḍī kāyaḥ] 'the body having many arteries'; @[bahutantī grīvā] 'the many-veined neck'; but @[bahutantīkaḥ stambhaḥ] 'a pillar with many ornamental lines'; @[bahutantikā] (many-stringed) @[vīṇā].

(d) to the final of the compound @[niṣpravāṇi] (@[nirgatā pravāṇī] 'a weaver's shuttle' @[yasya]) @[paṭaḥ] 'a new, unbleached garment.'

(e) to compounds formed according to rules §§ 251, 252, and 253; as @[saputraḥ], @[upabalaḥ], @[pratipattiḥ], &c.
