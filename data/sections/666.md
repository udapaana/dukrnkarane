There is a peculiar class of @[kṛt] or Primary affixes technically designated by Sanskrit grammarians—@[uṇādi] or those beginning with the affix @[uṇ] or @[u], i.e. the affix @[i] with the mute or indicatory letter @[ṇ], so called from the words @[kāruḥ] &c. in the first Sūtra being derived with the affix. These @[uṇādi] affixes form primary nouns, like other @[kṛt] affixes form verbal roots, but are classed separately because their application is limited, because the nouns derived by their means are either formed irregularly, or the connection between their senses and the meanings of roots from which they are supposed to be derived is not so clearly discernible as in the case of other primary derivatives; e.g. @[aśvaḥ] 'a horse' which is derived either from @[aś] 'to pervade,' or from @[aśva] 'to go;' and @[kāruḥ] &c. are 'an artisan' from @[kṛ] 'to do,' &c.
