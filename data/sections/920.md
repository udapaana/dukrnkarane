When a question is asked and an answer is given to it, the Present is used in the sense of the Past tense when the particle @[sma] is used; @[kva akārṣīḥ iti]—@[atra karomi sma] where @[karomi] is equivalent to @[akārṣam]; when the particles @[na] and @[nu] are used the Present may be optionally used; @[kva akārṣīḥ iti]—@[atra karomi] or @[na akārṣam]—@[nu karomi] or @[nu akārṣam].

"The principal use of the Present Indefinite is to express what is true at all times; 'the sun gives light; twice two is four' &c. Hence a more suitable name would be the Universal tense. It expresses present time only as representing all time. The permanent arrangements and laws of nature, the peculiarities, habits and propensities of living beings and whatever is constant, regular and uniform, have to be represented by the Present Indefinite. * * It is only by a special adverb or by the context that we can confine this tense to mean a present act solely." Bain, Higher English Grammar.
