rule: §784
---

(a) When a verb agrees with two or more subjects of different persons connected by 'and,' the first person has preference over the second or third, and the second over the third; @[tvam ahaṃ rāmaśca etat kariṣyāmaḥ] Rāma, you and I shall do this, @[tvaṃ rāmaśca pāṭhaśālāṃ gacchataḥ].

(b) But when the subjects are connected by 'or', the verb agrees with the one nearest to it @[tvam ahaṃ vā tat kariṣyāvaḥ] he or we accomplish that, @[ahaṃ rāmo'thavā rājā lakṣmaṇo vā mariṣyati] either I or King Rāma or Lakṣmaṇa will perish.
