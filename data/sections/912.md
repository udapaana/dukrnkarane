rule: §912

The infinitive cannot be used as the subject or object of a verb, abstract nouns supplying its place in this case. Where, therefore, the infinitive occurs in English as the subject or the object in a sentence, the abstract noun derived from the root must be used in Sanskrit; @[svadharmācaraṇaṃ hitam] (to do one's duty is beneficial) and not @[svadharmaṃ ācaritum].
