rule: §259
---

Two nouns alike in form in the Loc., and meaning 'something that can be seized,' or in the Instrumental, meaning 'weapons or things used as weapons,' may be compounded in a Bah. when the sense is 'the fight thus began' and the idea of an exchange of action is to be implied. In such compounds the final vowel of the first member is lengthened and that of the second is changed to @[i]. The compounds so formed are of the nature of Avyayībhāvas and are indeclinable. The final @[c] takes Guṇa substitute before the final @[i]. i.e. @[keśeṣu] @[keśeṣu] @[gṛhītvā] @[yuddhaṃ] @[pravṛttaṃ] @[keśākeśi] 'a battle in which the warriors fight seizing each other's hair'; @[daṇḍaiḥ] @[daṇḍeṣu] @[gṛhītvā] @[yuddhaṃ] @[pravṛttaṃ] @[daṇḍādaṇḍi]; similarly @[laguḍālaguḍi], @[hastāhasti], @[bāhubāhvi], @[carmācarmī], &c.; but if the instruments used by both the parties be not the same, no compound is possible; @[śaktilaguḍi] will, therefore, be wrong.

Obs.—(a) The following words also change their final to @[i] as @[daṇḍau] @[yasmin] @[praharaṇe] @[tad] @[vidaṇḍi]; similarly @[nirbāhuvi], @[ubhā-ubhayabāhvi], @[ubhāhasti], @[ubhayahasti], @[ubhā-ubhaya-pāṇi], @[ubhayapāṇi] &c.
