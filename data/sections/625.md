## § 625. The Frequentative or Intensive

A Frequentative or Intensive form may be derived from any monosyllabic root of the first nine classes, beginning with a consonant. The Frequentative or Intensive is used to signify the repetition or the intensity of the action denoted by the verb from which it is derived.
