\* The @[ṛ] (long) of a root, penultimate or final, when it does not take @[guṇa] or @[vṛddhi], is changed to @[ri], and to @[ru] if a labial or @[v] precedes; and the @[i] or @[u] is lengthened when @[ri] or @[ru] is followed by a consonant; e.g. @deva[जॄ] 4. P. 'to become old,' @deva[जीर्यति] @deva[अजीर्यत्], &c.; @deva[कॄ] 6. P. @deva[किरति], @deva[अकिरत्], &c.; here @deva[कि] does not become long as @deva[रि] is followed by @deva[अ]; @deva[कॄत्] 10. P. A. @deva[कीर्तयति-ते], @deva[अकीर्तयत्-त], &c.
