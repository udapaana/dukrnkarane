rule: §223
---

Names of quarters and numerals form a Karm. compound with any @[subanta] (a declinable word) but only when the whole compound is an appellation; e.g. @[uttarāhā] 'Name of a constellation of stars,' Ursa Major; @[pañcajanāḥ] †† &c., @[pūrvottarāupakāgrāmaḥ] 'Name of a town in the east,' @[uttare drumāḥ] 'Northern trees'; @[pañca brāhmaṇāḥ] &c. The compound is forbidden in other cases.

@[katham ekaḥ vīra iti pūrvaikatiketi bādhitvā paratvādanena samāsaḥ vīre prāptaḥ hi syāt | bahulaṃ grāhyam iti bhāṣyati |] How do you justify the form @[ekavīra]? For the Sūtra @[pūrvāpara] &c. being a subsequent one ought to have preference over the preceding Sūtra @[pūrvaikatike] &c. and we should have @[vīraikaḥ]. We reply.—The form may be justified by supposing that the rule operates in most cases only @[bahulagrahaṇāt] and not in a few).

† @[vara mahāt paramo 'ttamaḥ ukṛṣṭāḥ pūjyamānaḥ |] Pāṇ. II. 1. 61

‡ @[diksaṃkhye saṃjñāyām |] Pāṇ. II. 1. 61.

†† These are gods, men, Gandharvas, serpents, and @[piśācas], according to some, and @[brāhmaṇas], @[kṣatriyas], @[vaiśyas], @[śūdras] and @[niṣādas] or barbarians, according to others. (Vide @[śaṅkarācārya] on Brah. @[sū]. I. 4. 11-13.)

(a) But words denoting a cardinal point or numerals may be compounded with any other noun when a @[taddhita] termination is to be affixed to the compound so formed (or it conveys in addition to its sense as a Karm. a derivative meaning such as is usually denoted by a Tad. aff.) or when the compound itself becomes the first member of another compound or when the compound forms a proper name; @[pūrvā śālā pūrvaśālā]; @[pūrvaśālāyāṃ bhavaḥ paurvaśālaḥ] 'being in the eastern hall' from @[pūrvaśālā] + @[a] (a Tad. aff. @[a] added by @[tasmin iti nirdiṣṭe pūrvasya aḥ |] Pāṇ. IV. 2. 107), so @[ṣaṣ] + @[mātā] = @[ṣaṇmātṛ] 'six mothers' + Tad. @[a] = @[ṣāṇmāturahḥ] the son of six mothers, @[pūrvā kālā pūrvaśālā priyā yasya saḥ pūrvaśālāpriyaḥ] where @[pūrvaśālā] is a @[pūrvapada] and not used independently: @[uttaradharmaḥ], @[uttaravediḥ] &c. which are names.
