The @[kṛt] affixes (Vide § 337) are added to roots or to their modified forms to form nouns, adjectives, and indeclinables; e.g. @[īkāra], @[śa karaṇa], @[ṣet], @[kariṣyat], @[cakṛvas], @[sat] @[van] &c. These are called @[kṛdanta]s or Primary Nominal Bases as distinguished from the Secondary Derivatives formed with the @[taddhita] affixes.
