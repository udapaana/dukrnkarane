rule: §25

When @[e] or @[o] at the end of a word is followed by @[a] the latter merges into the former and the sign @[avagraha] is sometimes written in its place; e.g. @[hare] + @[a] = @[hare'va] protect, Oh Hari; @[viṣṇo] + @[a] = @[viṣṇo'va].

(a) If the word @[go], ending in @[o], be followed by @[a], the @[a] is optionally retained, and if by a vowel, @[av] is optionally substituted for @[o]; @[go] + @[agra] = @[gogratha], @[goagra] and @[gavāgra] a multitude of cows or chief among cows; but if it be followed by @[indra] and @[akṣa] it necessarily changes its @[o] to @[av]; @[go] + @[indraḥ] = @[gavindraḥ] an excellent bull; @[gavākṣaḥ] a lattice-window, similarly.
