## § 25. Elision of Initial अ After ए/ओ

When @deva[ए] @[e] or @deva[ओ] @[o] at the end of a word is followed by @deva[अ] @[a] the latter merges into the former and the sign @deva[ऽ] @['] is sometimes written in its place; e.g. @deva[हरे + अव = हरेऽव] @[hare + ava = hare'va] protect, Oh Hari; @deva[विष्णो + अव = विष्णोऽव] @[viṣṇo + ava = viṣṇo'va].

### (a) Special Rules for गो

If the word @deva[गो] @[go], ending in @deva[ओ] @[o], be followed by @deva[अ] @[a], the @deva[अ] @[a] is optionally retained, and if by a vowel, @deva[अव] @[ava] is optionally substituted for @deva[ओ] @[o]; @deva[गो + अग्र = गोग्र, गोऽग्र] @[go + agra = gogra, go'gra] and @deva[गवाग्र] @[gavāgra] a multitude of cows or chief among cows; but if it be followed by @deva[इन्द्र] @[indra] and @deva[अक्ष] @[akṣa] it necessarily changes its @deva[ओ] @[o] to @deva[अव] @[ava]; @deva[गो + इन्द्रः = गवेन्द्रः] @[go + indraḥ = gavendraḥ] an excellent bull; @deva[गवाक्षः] @[gavākṣaḥ] a lattice-window, similarly.
