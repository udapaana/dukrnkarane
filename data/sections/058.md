## § 58. The Vocative Case

The Vocative is considered to be a different aspect of the nominative and is identical with it in the dual and plural. It is, therefore, supposed to have no separate terminations of its own. In the singular it sometimes coincides with the original stem, sometimes with the nominative, at others, it differs from both.
