## § 160. The cardinal numbers between @deva[विंशति] and @deva[त्रिंशत्] ,

§ 160. The cardinal numbers between @deva[विंशति] and @deva[त्रिंशत्] ,
@deva[त्रिंशत्] and @deva[चत्वारिंशत्] , it will be seen, are made up by prefixing
@deva[एक], @deva[द्वि], &c. up to @deva[नवन्] to the lower. The ninth intermediate
number may also be made up by prefixing @deva[एकोन], @deva[ऊन] or @deva[एकान्न]
to the higher. In these compounds @deva[द्वि], @deva[त्रि] and @deva[अष्टन्] are changed
ao @deva[द्वा], @deva[त्रय]. and @deva[अष्टा] necessarily before @deva[विंशति] and @deva[त्रिंशत्] , and
optionally before the rest except @deva[अशीति] before which they
remain unchanged †
