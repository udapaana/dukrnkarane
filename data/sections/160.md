The cardinal numbers between @[viṃśati] and @[triṃśat], @[triṃśat] and @[catvāriṃśat], it will be seen, are made up by prefixing @[eka], @[dvi], &c. up to @[navan] to the lower. The ninth intermediate number may also be made up by prefixing @[ekona], @[ūna] or @[ekānna] to the higher. In these compounds @[dvi], @[tri] and @[aṣṭan] are changed to @[dvā], @[trayaḥ], and @[aṣṭā] necessarily before @[viṃśati] and @[triṃśat], and optionally before the rest except @[aśīti] before which they remain unchanged.
