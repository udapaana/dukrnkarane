In addition to the characters given above there are in Sanskrit two nasal sounds:—the one called @[anusvāra], is denoted by @deva[ं] i.e. a dot placed above the letter after which it is to be pronounced, e.g. @deva[कं]; the other, called @[anunāsika] is denoted by @deva[ँ] i.e. a dot within a semi-circle placed above the letter after which it is to be pronounced e.g. @deva[सँ].

(a) And a sort of hard breathing is known as @[visarga] (generally called @[visarjanīya] by Sanskrit grammarians). It is denoted by the sign: @deva[ः], i.e. two vertical dots placed after the letter after which it is to be pronounced. In pronunciation it is a harder aspirate than @deva[ह]. The @[visarga] is not an original character but only a substitute for a final @[s] or @[r].

(b) @[jihvāmūlīya] and @[upadhmānīya] are terms given to a sort of semi-@[visarga], when pronounced before @deva[क] @deva[ख], and @deva[प] @deva[फ] respectively. It is written symbolically as @deva[ᳵ] and @deva[ᳶ].

(c) The word @[akṣara] (lit. indestructible) is applied to all the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, except the two mentioned before, viz. @[anusvāra] and @[visarga], and @[repha] which is the name sometimes given to @deva[र]. The word @[kāra] is therefore used as an affix to denote a particular letter; e.g. @[jakāra] the letter @deva[ज], @[vakāra] the letter @deva[व], &c.
