A certain number of compounds and other words of irregular formation are classed under the head of @[pṛṣodarādi]. Any word whose formation cannot be properly explained is included into this group. These are to be taken as found in the language. The principal of these are:— @[pṛṣataḥ setum eṣodaraṃ] 'wind, air', @[hanti gacchati-iti haṃsati-iti vā haṃsaḥ] (either from @[han] or @[has]); @[hinasti-iti siṃhaḥ] (fr. @[hiṃs] conj. 7 to kill). @[yaścāsau ātmā guḍātmā] the soul that is concealed from the external senses; @[vāriṇāṃ āharaḥ balāhakaḥ] 'a cloud'; @[jīvanasya bhūtaḥ] (or @[bhājaḥ]) @[jīmūtaḥ] 'a cloud'; @[aśvāḥ] (dead bodies) @[kharanty iti kharaḥ], @[kṣavānāṃ śayanaṃ kṣavaṇam]; @[ūrdhvaṃ bhuvaḥ] + @[sthitaṃ ca yatra lūyatīti ulūkhaṃ] 'a wooden mortar', @[piśunam ācamati-iti piśācaḥ], @[tāvaraṃ tārakayānti sidanti-iti vṛṣī] 'the seat of ascetics or holy sages discussing philosophical subjects'; @[mayate asau, mahyāṃ rītīti vā mayūraḥ] 'a peacock.'

(a) @[tīra] becomes @[tara] optionally when compounded with the names of directions; as @[dakṣiṇatīram] or @[dakṣiṇataram]; @[uttaratīram taram] &c.

(b) Obs.—@[dur] becomes @[du] in the following cases:—@[duḥkhena dīyate durdaḥ] 'difficult to be given or hurt'; @[duḥkhena nīyate duṣṇāghaḥ] 'not easy to be destroyed:' @[duḥkhena dabhyate duḍabhaḥ] 'difficult to be injured or impelled:' @[duḥkhena dhyāyati-iti dudhyaḥ] &c.
