Two adjectives may also be compounded into what is called the @[viśeṣaṇapūrvapadakarmadhāraya] as @deva[शुक्लकृष्ण], @deva[कृष्णसारङ्ग].

(1). Two participles expressive of two consecutive actions of the same individual may be compounded together, the one expressive of the previous action being placed first, @deva[आदौ स्नातः पश्चादनुलिप्तः] = @deva[स्नातानुलिप्त] 'first bathed and then anointed'; similarly @deva[पीतवान्तः] 'first drunk and afterwards vomited out' in @deva[पीतपरिवान्तः], @deva[गृहीतप्रतिमुक्तः] (Ragh. II. 1. IV. 43), &c.

(2). In the case of the two sets of words given above (§ 222.2.) forming compounds with one another those beginning with @[pūrva] are placed first. In the case of @[eka] compounded with @[vīra] it may precede or follow @[vīra]; as @[vīraika] or @[ekavīra]; the former, however, is preferable. In the case of the first set of words @[viz.] @[eka]..., @[kevala] the one succeeding precedes the one preceding when compounded together; as @[purāṇajarat], @[kevalapurāṇam], &c.

(3). A past participle is compounded with another with the negative particle prefixed to it; @deva[कृताकृतम्], 'what is done and not done, i.e. 'partially done'.

(4). The word @[yuvan] (m. f.) enters into a Karm. comp. with the words @[khalati], @[palita], @[valita] having wrinkles, and @[jaratī], and is placed first; e.g. @[yuvā] + @[khalatiḥ] = @[yuvakhalatiḥ] 'a young bald-headed man', 'a young bald-headed woman'; @[yuvajaratī] 'a young woman looking old'; @[yuvapalitaḥ] 'a young man whose hair is grey', &c.
