rule: §193

When words ending in @[a] and implying relationship by blood or literary vocation are compounded together, the last but one word changes its @[a] to @[ā]. The same happens when the word @[udyāj] follows a word ending in @[a] under the same circumstances; @[hotā] @[ca] @[potā] @[ca] @[hotāpotārau] two priests so called, @[hotā] @[ca] @[potā] @[ca] @[neṣṭā] @[ca] @[udgātā] @[ca] @[hotṛpotṛneṣṭodgātāraḥ], (but if two words be taken at a time the @[a] may, at every step, be changed into @[ā]; as @[hotā] @[ca] @[potā] @[ca] @[hotāpotau] @[tau] @[ca] @[udgātā] @[ca] @[hotāpotodgātāraḥ] &c.); @[pitā] @[ca] @[duhitā] @[ca] @[pitāduhitarau], @[mātā] @[ca] @[pitā] @[ca] @[mātāpitarau], also @[mātarapitarau] (vide § 197 a), and @[pitarau] (vide § 197 a).
