Instances of the elision of the Gen. The noun in the Genitive may retain its case ending—

(a) when reproach is to be implied; as @[śunaḥpriyaḥ], but @[śvapriyaḥ]. Also when @[dvandvānām] is followed by @[priya] and the whole means a fool; otherwise @[dvandvapriyaḥ].

(b) when the words @[vāc], @[div] and @[pada] are followed by @[yukti], @[daṇḍa] and @[hara] respectively; as @[vācoyuktiḥ] 'skilful speech'; @[divo daṇḍaḥ] 'a particular appearance of stars in the shape of a staff in the sky;' @[padastodhāraḥ] 'one who robs another in his very presence while he is looking on,' hence 'a goldsmith, a rogue.'

(c) in the following cases:—@[kāśyādhipatiḥ] 'a king of Kashi', @[divaspatīḥ] 'Indra', @[vācaspatiḥ] lord of speech, Bṛhaspati; @[śunaḥśepaḥ], @[śyenaściṣṭaḥ] and @[śunaḥlāṅgūlaḥ] 'sons of Ajigarta.'

(d) and optionally when followed by @[putra] and censure is implied; @[dāsyāḥ putraḥ] or @[dāsīputraḥ] a bastard, a knave; but @[brāhmaṇīputraḥ]

@[kālādhvanortyādibhāge] | Pāṇ. II. 2. 5.

@[prāgdīvyatorupapade samānādhikaraṇaḥ] | Pāṇ. II. 2. 6.

@[ṣaṣṭhī ca ākrośe] | Pāṇ. VI. 3. 21. @[dvandvānāṃ priya iti ca mūrkhe vācādīdaṇḍahareyoḥ] | @[yuktidaṇḍaharāḥ tu kāśipatipadāhvādiliṅgoḥ śunaḥ] | @[divaśca dāse] | Vārttikas. '@[prādhāmikatatpuruṣa]' Pāṇ. VI. 3. 22.

(e) When a word ending in @[ṛ] is compounded with another and there is the relation by blood or some kind of learning, the @[aluk] is necessary; and optional when it is followed by @[svasṛ] and @[pati]. The initial @[s] of @[svasṛ] is optionally changed to @[ṣ] when preceded by any @[ṛ] or its substitutes and when there is @[aluk], and necessarily when there is no @[aluk] in a compound; e.g. @[hotṛputraḥ], @[hotṛśiṣyaḥ], a pupil of the Hotṛ; @[mātuḥsvasā], or @[mātuḥṣvasā] and @[mātṛṣvasā]; so @[pituḥsvasā], &c. (but @[mātuḥ svasā], @[pituḥ svasā] when uncompounded); @[svasṛpatiḥ] or @[svasṛpatiḥ]; but @[hotṛdhanam].
