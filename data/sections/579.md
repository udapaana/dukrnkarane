The @[parasmaipada] terminations of this mood may be obtained by prefixing @[yās] to those of the Imperfect, dropping its final @[s] before the @[t] and @[m] of the 2nd and 3rd per. sings.; and the Ātmanepada ones by prefixing @[sī] to the terminations of the Atm. Potential and also to the @[t] and @[th] occurring in them. These, therefore, are:—

| Parasmai. | | | Ātmane. | | |
|-----------|---|---------|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1 @[yām] | @[yāva] | @[yāsma] | 1 @[sīya] | @[sīvahi] | @[sīmahi] |
| 2 @[yāḥ] | @[yāstam] | @[yāsta] | 2 @[sīṣṭhāḥ] | @[sīyāsthām] | @[sīdhvam] |
| 3 @[yāt] | @[yāstām] | @[yāsuḥ] | 3 @[sīṣṭa] | @[sīyāstām] | @[sīran] |
