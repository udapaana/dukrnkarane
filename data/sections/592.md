The passive base is conjugated like a root of the 4th class in the Ātm.; e.g.

[It might even be suspected, that the occasional assumption of an Intransitive signification and a @[parasmaipada] inflexion by a passive verb, was the cause which gave rise to a 4th class of Primitive verbs as distinct from the passive. Instances are certainly found of passive verbs taking @[parasmaipada] terminations, and some passive verbs (e.g. @[jāyate], 'he is born,' fr. @[jan]; @[pūryate], 'he is filled,' fr. @[pṛ]; and @[tapyate] 'he is heated,' fr. @[tap]) are regarded by native grammarians as Ātmane. verbs of cl. 4. Again, many roots appear in class 4 as Intransitive verbs, which also appear in some one of the other nine as Transitive. For example, @[yuj], 'to join' when used in a Transitive sense, is conjugated either in cl. 7, or in the causal; when in an Intransitive, in cl. 4. So also @[puṣ], 'to nourish,' @[kṣubh], 'to agitate;' @[kleś] 'to vex'; @[sidh], 'to accomplish.'
