## § 337. Primary and Secondary Nominal Bases

The terminations used to form derivative bases in Sanskrit are distinguished into two classes: (1) @deva[कृत्] @[kṛt] or Primary Affixes and (2) @deva[तद्धित] @[taddhita] or Secondary Affixes.

@deva[कृत्] @[Kṛt] are those affixes that are added to verbs, and the Nominal Bases formed by their means are called PRIMARY NOMINAL BASES.

@deva[तद्धित] @[Taddhita] affixes are those that are added to substantives, primary or derived from roots, and the bases formed with them are called SECONDARY NOMINAL BASES (vide § 179).
