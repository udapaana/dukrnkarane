The terminations used to form derivative bases in Sanskrit are distinguished into two classes: (1) @[kṛt] or Primary Affixes and (2) @[taddhita] or Secondary Affixes. @[kṛt] are those affixes that are added to verbs, and the Nominal Bases formed by their means are called Primary Nominal Bases; while @[taddhita] affixes are those that are added to substantives, primary or derived from roots, and the bases formed with them are called Secondary Nominal Bases (vide § 179).
