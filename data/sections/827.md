(a) A noun expressive of the purpose for which anything is done, or the result to which anything leads or the effect for which anything exists, is put in the Dative case; @[muktaye hariṃ bhajati] 'worships Hari for final beatitude;' @[bhaktir jñānāya kalpate saṃpādyate jāyate vā] 'devotion leads to knowledge;' @[peya kalpate jāyate avapāya mūtrapurīṣayoḥ] (Mb.) 'water gruel tends to (produce) urine,' @[kuṇḍalāya hiraṇyam] (Mah. Bhāṣ.) 'gold for @[kuṇḍala] (a kind of ornament);' @[yūpāya dāru] 'wood for a sacrificial post,' &c.

N. B.—The roots @[bhū] or @[as] are often omitted after a Dative used in this sense @[kāvyaṃ yaśase (bhavati)], 'poetry is for fame.'

(b) An evil foreboded by a portentous phenomenon is also put in the Dative case; @[vātāya vidyullekha pītā] 'the tawny lightning forebodes a storm.'

(c) The word @[hita] is used with the Dative; @[brāhmaṇāya hitam] 'good for a Brāhmaṇa.'
