If a conjunct consonant begins a root, the first consonant only with the following vowel is reduplicated; e.g. @deva[प्रथ्] = @deva[पप्रथ्].

(c) If the first member of a conjunct consonant, however, be a sibilant (@deva[श], @deva[ष], @deva[स]) and the second a hard consonant, the hard consonant is reduplicated: @deva[स्तु] = @deva[तस्तु], @deva[स्फुट्] = @deva[पस्फुट्]; but @deva[स्वन्] = @deva[सस्वन्], &c.
