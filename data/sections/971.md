## § 971. The Particle @deva[इति] @[iti]

As @deva[अयु] @[ayu] marks the beginning, so @deva[इति] @[iti] marks the close of a composition. This particle is used in the following senses:

**(1) Quotation marks:** To quote the exact words spoken or spoken to, it is placed at the place of the quotation marks and being used generally after the words quoted.

Example: A certain Chandaka girl requests Your Majesty to command that those who have come to your majesty's feet wish to enjoy the happiness of the sight of Your Majesty; @deva[एतावेतौ अर्थः एकः स्यात्] @[etāvetau arthaḥ ekaḥ syāt] these two have accomplished one object.

**(2) Cause:** Rendered in English as "because", "since", etc.

- @deva[अदेशकोऽस्मीति पृच्छामि] @[adeśako'smīti pṛcchāmi] I ask you because I am a foreigner
- @deva[पुराणमित्यस्य न बाधा भवेत्] @[purāṇamityasya na bādhā bhavet] everything is not good simply because it is old

**(3) Purpose or motive:** That there should be; in order that.

Example: They have come with a limited number of servants with them that there should be no disturbance.

**(4) So, thus, as follows**

**(5) In the capacity of; as regards:**

- @deva[पिता इति] @[pitā iti] as a father he ought to be respected
- @deva[गुरु इति] @[guru iti] as a teacher ought to be censured

**(6) To state an opinion:**

@deva[इति आश्मरथ्यः] @[iti Āśmarathyaḥ] this is the opinion of Āśmarathya.

It is often used by commentators in the sense of "according to the rule": @deva[इति निर्देशात् लिट्] @[iti nirdeśāt liṭ] etc.

**Note:** In Sanskrit there is no indirect construction, so that in translating indirect constructions the actual words of the speaker followed by @deva[इति] @[iti] must be used.
