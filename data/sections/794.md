## § 794. When a relative pronoun refers to an antecedent,

§ 794.  When  a  relative  pronoun  refers  to  an  antecedent,
it must agree with it  in  gender  and  number,  not  in  case:
@deva[यः पुरुषः स आगतः] that man has  come  ( the  relative  and  the
demonstrative are here in the nominative );  @deva[येन  पुरुषेण  स  गतः]
that man has gone ( the relative is in the  instr.  while  the  de-
monstrative is in the nominative  );  @deva[यं  पुरुषं  तं  पश्यामि]  I  see
that man ( the relative is in the accusative  while  the  demons-
trative is in the nominative ).
