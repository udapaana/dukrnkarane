The only portion of Syntax treated separately in Sanskrit grammars is the @[kārakaprakaraṇa] or the chapter on Government. @[kāraka] is the name given to the relation subsisting between a noun and a verb in a sentence. There are six @[kāraka]s in Sanskrit belonging to the first seven cases, except the Genitive, which is, therefore, not a @[kāraka] case. These are @[kartā], @[karma], @[karaṇa], @[saṃpradāna], @[apādāna] and @[adhikaraṇa].
