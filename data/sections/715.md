Roots having @[a] for their penultimate and ending in a consonant of the labial class take the affix @[ya]; @[dābh]—@[dābhya]; @[rabh]—@[rabhya]; @[labh]—@[labhya], &c.

(a) When @[labh] is preceded by @[ā], @[bh] (changed to @[m]) is inserted between @[ā] and @[labh]; @[ālam]—@[ālambhya] 'what ought or is fit to be killed;' @[m] is also inserted when @[labh] is preceded by @[upa] if the meaning be 'to praise;' @[upalambhyaḥ sādhuḥ] 'a Sadhu ought to be praised;' but @[upalabhyaṃ dhanam] 'wealth ought to be acquired.'
