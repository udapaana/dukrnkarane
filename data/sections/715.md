## § 715. Roots having @deva[अ] for their penultimate and ending in

§ 715.  Roots having @deva[अ] for their penultimate and ending in
a consonant of the labial class take the affix @deva[य];  @deva[शाप्]-@deva[शाप्य]; @deva[छुषु]-
@deva[छुष्य]: @deva[रप्]-@deva[रप्य], &c.

(a) When @deva[ळुप्] is preceded by @deva[अप्], @deva[य्] ( changed to @deva[इ] ) is inserted
between @deva[इ] and @deva[प्]; @deva[अपेळाप्]-@deva[भाउप्य]: ' what  ought  or is  fit  to be
killed ;' @deva[य] is also inserted  when @deva[छुप्] is preceded by  @deva[उप]  if the
meaning be 'to prise;' @deva[उपक्षुप्य]: @deva[यायै]: 'a Sādhu ought to be
praised ;' but @deva[उपकुष्युं धनं] 'wealth ought to be acquired.'
