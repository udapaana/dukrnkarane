Special rules about the admission of the intermediate @[i] before the terminations @[ca], @[ma], @[tha], @[se], @[vahe], @[mahe], @[dhve]; see (§ 457).

(a) All roots, whether set or anit, except @[h], @[vā], @[mnā], @[mā], @[stu], @[kṣ], @[gā], and @[yā] admit, @[d] and @[dh] with @[yā], and @[h] admit it before @[tha]; as @[saṃcaskaritha], @[babaritha].

(b) Anit roots ending in short @[ṛ], except @[h], reject it before @[a]; as @[sasmartha] from @[smṛ]; but @[āritha] from @[ṛ].

(c) Anit roots with a final vowel or with a penultimate @[a] admit it optionally before @[ya].
