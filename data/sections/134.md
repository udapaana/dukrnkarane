## § 134. ( a ) The optional shorter forms of the pronouns

§ 134. ( a ) The optional shorter forms of the pronouns
@deva[अस्मद्] and @deva[युष्मद्] are never used at the beginning of a sentence
or of a foot of a metre; * nor can they be used immediately
before the particles @deva[च], @deva[वा], @deva[इ] or @deva[ह], @deva[अह] and @deva[एवः]; as @deva[मम यह्] my
house, and not @deva[मे यह्म]; @deva[चैदैरशौकैः संवयोऽस्मान् कृष्णः सर्वदात्वच] ( Sid.
Kau. ), ' may Kṛshṇa, revered throughout or capable of being
known properly from all the Vedas, always protect us; and
not @deva[नः कृष्णः] &c.; @deva[तवैव छन्दोमेतत्] ' this is surely your deed,' and
not @deva[ते एष] &c But if these particles do not connect these forms
they may be used with them @deva[म]; as @deva[हरो हरिश्च मे स्वामी] ( Sid. Kau. )
Hara and Hari are my lords, &c.
