## § 300. @deva[तिष्ठद्गुः ॥]

§ 300. @deva[तिष्ठद्गुः ॥]

The augment @deva[गुक्] is added to a word ending in @deva[ति] when forming an Avyayībhāva compound.

Example:— @deva[अभीति] 'fearlessness' becomes @deva[अभीगुति] in certain formations.

Obs. This is a special phonetic rule for certain compounds.
