## § 124. There are very few bases ending in @deva[ह्]; of these

§ 124. There are very few bases ending in @deva[ह्]; of these
are @deva[माही] earth, and @deva[दुह्] ( milk-giver ). As regards the decl. of
@deva[माही], @deva[वाह्] ( bearing along, Lat. "veho" ) in the mas., @deva[वह्नि]
( fire ) and words derived from roots of the class @deva[क्रय्] ( to buy )
&c., final @deva[ह्] after short vowel is generally dropped, along with
the nom. affix, the vowel being lengthened as its substitute, or
the vowel @deva[अ] being added ( the substitute for the nom. affix
@deva[विसर्ग] ). Thus we have from @deva[माही], the nom. @deva[सं० माही] or @deva[माहः], from
@deva[वाह्] we get @deva[वाः] or @deva[वाट्], and @deva[क्रयि] gives @deva[क्रयी] or @deva[क्रयः ॥] In the voc. @deva[सं०]
we get @deva[माही] or @deva[माहि] ( @deva[माह्], @deva[उष्]-@deva[उष] = @deva[माह्], Pan. VIII. 3. 44, 46 ), @deva[वाट्],
or @deva[वाहो] ( @deva[वाह्] + @deva[ओ] = @deva[वाहः], Pan. VIII. 3. 44, 46 ), @deva[वह्] or @deva[वाट् ॥]
Similarly @deva[वह्नि] ( fire, Lat. "ignis" ) makes its nom. @deva[सं०], @deva[वह्निः] or
@deva[वह्निः] by the guna-substitution for the final of the base @deva[ह्नि]
( Pan. VIII. 2. 77 ). Before other cases, @deva[ह्] → @deva[ढ्] → @deva[ह्] as
@deva[वह्निभ्याम्], @deva[वह्निभिः], @deva[वह्निभ्यः] &c. @deva[॥]
