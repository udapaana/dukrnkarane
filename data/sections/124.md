These are the perfect participles derived from roots with the affix @[vas] to which the intermediate @[n] is prefixed in some cases. They have a @[m] prefixed to their final @[s] in the first five inflections, the penultimate @[a] being lengthened before it. In the Nom. sing. m., the @[m] is dropped and the Voc. sing. ends in @[van]. @[u] is substituted for @[v], before which the preceding short @[a], if any, is dropped, before the vowel terminations beginning with those of the Acc. plu. and before the @[u] of the Nom. Voc. and Acc. dual of the neuter nouns. The final @[d] of a root is changed to @[t] before @[v]. @[n] reappears before this @[u]; final @[a] is changed to @[i] before the consonantal terminations and in the Nom. Voc. and Acc. sing. of the neuter.
