## § 937. Future with Conditional Hope

When there is the idea of hope implied in a conditional form, the Aorist, the Present or the Simple Future may be used in both the clauses to denote a future time:

**Example:**

@deva[दैवदराल्यात् नाति वरुत्यति वा यारायास्या बसायः वस्याः वा] @[daivadarālyāt nāti varutyati vā yārāyāsyā basāyaḥ vasyāḥ vā] (Sid. Kau.) If it were to rain it would sow corn.

**Pāṇini Reference:** @deva[आशासयायं पातच्यच्छु ।] @[āśāsayāyaṃ pātacyaccchu |] (Pāṇ. III. 3. 132)
