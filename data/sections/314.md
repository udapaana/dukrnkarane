@[Pratipadika]s expressive of colour, having @[ta] for their penultimate and ending in an @[anudātta] vowel, except @[asita] black and @[palita] grey, and the word @[piśaṅga] form their feminine in @[ī] or @[ā]; @[citra] or @[citrī] 'variegated' from @[citra]; @[rohita], @[rohitī]; @[piśaṅga] - @[piśaṅgī]; but @[asitā], @[palitā], @[śvetā] (as the @[ta] here is @[udātta]).

(a) But if the @[pratipadika] has no @[ta] for its penultimate, it simply takes @[ī]; @[kalmāṣī] variegated, @[śyāmī]; but @[kṛṣṇā] @[śvetā] (as the last vowels are not @[anudātta]).
