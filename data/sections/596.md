## § 596. Futures, Conditional, Benedictive in Passive

The forms of the two Futures, Conditional and the Benedictive of the Passive are made up in the same way as those of the Active, every root being supposed Atmanepadi. Roots ending in a vowel and @deva[हन्], @deva[ग्रह्], @deva[द्रश्] optionally form these by changing vowel to Vṛddhi.
