At the end of a Bah. compound—

(a) @[jānu] is changed to @[jāni] necessarily when preceded by @[pra] or @[sam] and optionally when preceded by @[su]; @[pragatau jānū yasya saḥ prajāniḥ] 'one having the knees wide apart' i. e., 'bandy-legged;' @[sujāniḥ] 'one having well-turned or beautiful knees;' @[dīrghajānuḥ] 'long-shanked.'

(b) @[jāyā] becomes @[jāni]; @[yuvatī jāyā yasya saḥ yuvajāniḥ] 'one whose wife is young;' @[bhūjāniḥ] lit. 'one whose wife is the earth,' i. e. a king,' &c.

(c) @[gandha] becomes @[gandhi] when preceded by @[ud], @[pūti] or @[su]; @[udgataḥ gandhaḥ yasya saḥ udgaṃdhiḥ] 'whose smell is spread above,' @[pūtigaṃdhiḥ] 'having a repulsive smell,' @[sugaṃdhiḥ]. This change of @[gandha] is possible only when the smell referred to is inseparably connected with (looks like a part and parcel of) the object denoted by the other member; as @[sugaṃdhi saraḥ salilaṃ ca] (which receives its odour from the lotuses &c. growing in it;) @[sugaṃdhi puṣpam]; but @[sukhā gandhā asya iti sugandha āpaṇikaḥ] 'a perfumer dealing in sweet smells.' @[gandha] is also changed to @[gaṃdhi] when it means 'a particle of,' 'a little of,' or when the compound involves comparison; as @[sūpasya gandhaḥ yasmin tat sūpagaṃdhi bhojanam]; 'a dinner in which there is a scanty supply of ghee, &c.;' @[padmasya iva gandhaḥ yasya tat padmagaṃdhi] 'that which has the smell of a lotus.'

(d) @[nāsikā] becomes @[nas] when it is preceded by a preposition or when the compound is used as a distinguishing name and it is preceded by any word except @[śūla]; @[ugratā nāsikā yasya sa ugranaḥ] 'one having a prominent nose,' @[praṇasaḥ] 'one having a good nose,' @[vṛkṣa nāsikā yasya duḥnasaḥ] 'one whose nose is like a tree,' 'large-nosed;' but @[śūlanāsikaḥ]. @[nas] becomes @[nas] optionally when preceded by @[khura] or @[khara]; as @[khuraṇasaḥ] or @[khuranāsaḥ] 'having a nose like a horse's hoof' i. e., flat;' @[kharaṇasaḥ-nāsaḥ] 'sharp-nosed.' @[nāsikā] when preceded by @[vi] becomes @[nas] or @[nās]; as @[vigatā nāsikā yasya sa viṇasaḥ] or @[vināsaḥ] 'one having a deformed nose.'
