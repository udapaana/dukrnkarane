rule: §147

@[anya] 'another,' @[anyatara] 'either of two,' @[apara] 'other,' @[ekatama] 'one of many,' @[katara] 'who or which of two,' @[katama] 'who or which of many,' @[yatara] 'who or which of two,' @[yatama] 'who or which of many,' @[tatara] 'that one (of two),' @[tatama] 'that one (of many),' are declined in all the three genders like @[yad]; e.g.

**mas.**

N. @[kataraḥ] @[katarau] @[katare]

**fem.**

N. @[katarā] @[katare] @[katarāḥ]

**neu.**

N. & A. @[katarat] @[katare] @[katarāṇi]

&c.

N. B.—@[a] is not a pronoun, as it is not mentioned in the @[sūtra] @[sarvādi] (@[sarvādi-nī pratyayāḥ pariṇāmābhāvāt saṃjñā]. Sid. Kau.). It is, therefore, declined like nouns ending in @[a].
