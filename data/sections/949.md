## § 949. Repeated Imperative for Frequency

There is a peculiar use of the Imperative which ought to be noticed. The Imperative second person singular is repeated when frequency of an act is indicated and the whole used with the root in any tense:

**Examples:**

- @deva[याहि याहि हति गति] @[yāhi yāhi hati gati] (Sid. Kau.) he goes every now and then
- @deva[पकाहि पकाहि पक्षां पकाहि] @[pakāhi pakāhi pakṣāṃ pakāhi] (Sid Kau) he cooks
- @deva[अध्यापय अध्यायते] @[adhyāpaya adhyāyate] he studies steadily

The Imperative second person is also used when several acts are described as done by the same person:

- @deva[शकुच्छ फिरु, पानः सुदचंयुहारति] @[śakuccha phiru, pānaḥ sudacaṃyuhārati] (Sid. Kau.) he takes his meal, now eating fruit, now eating fried rice
- Similarly: @deva[अखनं वदय दविकंयवरयते] @[akhanaṃ vadaya davikaṃyavara­yate] (Sid. Kau.)

**Pāṇini Reference:** @deva[क्रियासयनेयुरो लोट् छन्दसो छन्दोतो हित्यदो वा च तस्यानो ।] @[kriyāsayane­yuro loṭ chandaso chandoto hityado vā ca tasyāno |] (Pāṇ. III. 4. 1-5)
