There is a peculiar use of the imperative which ought to be noticed. The imperative second person singular is repeated when frequency of an act is indicated and the whole used with the root in any tense; @[yāhi yāhi iti yāti] (Sid. Kau.): he goes every now and then; so @[yāta yāta iti yāta yāyāt]; @[yāhi yāhi ityāyāsīt]; @[adhīṣva adhīṣvety adhīte] he studies steadily. The imperative second person is also used when several acts are described as done by the same person; @[saktūn piba dhānān khāda ityabhyavaharati] (Sid. Kau.) he takes his food, now eating barley, now eating fried rice, similarly @[annaṃ sūpa dadhi madhu āsvādayetyabhyavaharate] (Sid. Kau.).
