The roots @[vyavahṛ] (s. e. @[hṛ] with @[vi] and @[ava]), @[paṇ] and @[div] when they all mean to transact business, or to stake in gambling, govern the Genitive of their object; @[śatasya vyavaharati] invests a hundred rupees in business; @[prāṇānām apaṇat] he staked his life; @[adevīd bhrātṝṇām ānandānāṃ] lost his brothers and pleasures in gambling, &c.; but when @[div] is preceded by a preposition, the Accusative may also be used; @[śatasya vā śataṃ pratidīvyati] (Sid. Kau.)
