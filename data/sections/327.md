A @[bahuvrīhi] ending in @[at] forms its fem. in @[ā] optionally; e.g. @[su] + @[parvat] = @[suparvat]—@[suparvatā] or @[suparvatī], @[bahu] + @[yajvat] = @[bahuyajvatā] or @[bahuyajvatī], &c. but if the word ending in @[an] be such as drops its @[a] before the @[ā] of the Inst. sing., it takes @[ī] also optionally; e.g. @[bahu] + @[rājan]—@[bahurājat]—@[bahurājatā]—@[bahurājñī] &c.

(a) If a Bah. ends in @[dhīvat], the @[vat] is optionally changed to @[var], as @[bahudhīvat]—@[bahudhīvatā] or @[bahudhīvarī] a town in which there are many fishermen.
