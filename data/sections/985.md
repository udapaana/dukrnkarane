§ 13. This is the commonest of all Sanskrit metres; it forms the chief metre of the great epics and many of the Purāṇas.

There are many varieties of this metre; but that in which there are eight syllables in a @deva[पाद] @[pāda], the fifth being short and no deviation from these rules occur in the Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa.

Examples in the 1st Canto of @deva[रघुवंश] @[Raghuvamśa].
