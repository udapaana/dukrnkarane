The @[saḥ] of @[puṃs] is changed to an @[anusvāra] and @[visarga] when followed by a form of the root @[kṛ], the @[anusvāra] again is optionally changed to an @[anunāsika]; e.g. @[puṃs] + @[kartā] = @[puṃskartā] and @[puṃskartā]; @[s] is affixed to the ending of the words @[yuvan], @[maghavan] and @[kānt]; so @[puṃskartā] and @[puṃsskartā].

N. 2. The word @[puṃskartā] is capable of having 108 different forms as several @[sūtra]s are brought to bear upon it; but they are not given here as being tedious and of no material value.

Sections a, b, c, and d may be omitted by beginners.

(a) The @[s] of @[puṃs] is optionally nasalised and has @[s] added to it as above, when it is followed by a hard consonant except a sibilant, preceding a vowel, a semivowel, a nasal or @[h]; @[puṃs] + @[kokilaḥ] = @[puṃm] + @[s] + @[kokilaḥ] = @[puṃskokilaḥ], @[puṃskokilaḥ] a male cuckoo; so @[puṃsputraḥ] and @[puṃsputraḥ] the son, a grown up man; but @[puṃse] milk for a man; @[puṃsdāsaḥ] a man-servant. Exception @[puṃsgatam] the account of a man.

(b) @[n] at the end of a word (except @[yuvan]) followed by a @[ś] or @[ṣ] or @[s], which is itself followed by a vowel, a semi-

vowel, a nasal or @[h] undergoes the same changes; e.g. @[yuvan] + @[chindhi] = @[yuvañ] + @[s] + @[chindhi] = @[yuvañschindhi] (by § 28, sec. c) @[yuvañschindhi] and @[yuvañschindhi] Oh Kṛṣṇa, cut off; similarly @[kṛṣṇa] + @[trāyasva] = @[kṛṣṇañstrāyasva] and @[kṛṣṇañstrāyasva]; save, Oh Kṛṣṇa; but @[hanti] as the @[n] is not at the end of a word. @[puṃstaruḥ] a fine handle of a sword. @[prakṛṣṭāntanoti] a good man spreads.

(c) The @[n] of @[yuvan] when followed by @[ch] undergoes this change optionally; @[yuvan] + @[pāhi] = @[yuvampāhi], @[yuvañschpāhi] and @[yuvanpāhi].

(d) The @[n] of @[kānt] followed by @[kāca] also undergoes this change optionally; @[kānt] + @[kācaḥ] = @[kāṃskācaḥ], @[kāṃskācaḥ] to whom?

@[s] is substituted for the @[visarga] when the following sets are combined: @[kaḥ] + @[kaḥ] = @[kaśca] + @[kaḥ]; similarly @[kutaścataḥ] wherefrom, @[namaskāraḥ], @[sayaskālaḥ] the present time, @[sarpiṣkuṇḍikā] a ghee-pot, @[cāpuṣkapālam] a bowstaff; @[yajñuṣpātram] a sacrificial vessel; @[upayaskāntaḥ] a magnet; @[tamaskāṇḍaḥ] great darkness; @[ayaskāṇḍaḥ]; @[bhāskaraḥ]; @[ahaskaraḥ] the sun.
