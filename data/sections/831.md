The indirect object of the root @[man] cl. 4. 'to think' if not an animal, may be put in the Accusative or the Dative case when contempt is to be shown; @[na tvāṃ tṛṇāya manye vā] I do not consider thee a straw; but @[na tvāṃ tṛṇaṃ manye] (@[man] Dh.; S.) when mere comparison is meant, the Accusative is used, @[tṛṇaṃ sa manye] (Mb.)

- @[manyakarmaṇyanādare vibhāṣāprāṇiṣu]. P. II. 3. 17. On @[aprāṇiṣu] Kātyāyana remarks "@[aprāṇiṣu ityapadīśya naukānnakākavamakasṛgālavyāghravyeti vaktavyam]". S. K. Instead of 'If not an animal' it should be said, 'If not one of a ship, or food or a crow or a parrot or a jackal or a cat' @[nāvaṃ manye] or @[nāvāya]; @[annaṃ vā manye] or @[annāya]; @[śvānaṃ vā manye] or @[śvānāya]; in the former case though neither @[nau] nor @[anna] is an animal, the Accusative ought to be used, in the latter though @[śvāna] is an animal the Dative may be optionally used.
