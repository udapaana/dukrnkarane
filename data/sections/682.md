In the Conjugational Tenses the @[Ātm.] Freq. Base is conjugated like the Conjugational base of the 4th class in @[Ātm.] In the General Tenses, and in all the Tenses of the passive, the base loses its final @[ya] when the final @[ya] is preceded by a vowel, and drops the @[ya] itself, when it is preceded by a consonant. As regards the perfect, the Freq. Base takes the Periphrastic perfect. In the aorist the @[Ātm.] terminations of the 5th form are added. In the remaining Tenses the @[Ātm.] terminations with the intermediate @[i] prefixed to them are added as usual. The passive is also formed like the passive of derived verbs.
