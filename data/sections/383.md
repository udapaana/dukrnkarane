## § 383. When a root is capable of taking either pada, the Parasmaipada (lit: word for another) should be use

§ 383 When a root is capable of taking either pada, the Parasmaipada (lit: word for another) should be used when the fruit or result of the action of the verb accrues to any other person or thing than the agent, and the Ātmanepada ( lit. word for self ) when it refers to the agent.  Thus @deva[देवदत्त]: @deva[पुजति] will mean ' Devadatta sacrifices for another ( his Yajamāna );' while @deva[देवदत्त]: @deva[पुजते] will mean ' Devadatta sacrifices for himself.'
