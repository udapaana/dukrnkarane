rule: §383

When a root is capable of taking either @[pada], the @[parasmaipada] (lit. word for another) should be used when the fruit or result of the action of the verb accrues to any other person or thing than the agent, and the @[ātmanepada] (lit. word for self) when it refers to the agent. Thus @[devadattaḥ yajati] will mean 'Devadatta sacrifices for another (i.e. his @[yajamāna]);' while @[devadattaḥ yajate] will mean 'Devadatta sacrifices for himself.'
