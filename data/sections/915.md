The infinitive in Sanskrit has no passive form. In turning, therefore, an active construction involving an infinitive into a passive one, the verb should be changed into the passive, the infinitive and the words governed by it remaining unaffected—@[rāmaḥ āśramaṃ gantuṃ icchati], @[tena āśramaṃ gantuṃ iṣyate]—except where the object of the infinitive and the verb is the same, @[sa bhāraṃ voḍhum icchati]; @[tena bhāro voḍhum iṣyate].
