@[tara] and @[tama] are the most common terminations of the comparative and the superlative degrees respectively. They are added to that crude form of words which they assume before the Inst. dual termination; e.g. @[ayam etābhyāṃ laghutaraḥ], @[ayaṃ laghutaraḥ], @[ayam eṣām atiśayena laghutamaḥ]; similarly @[gurutara], @[yuvatara], @[vṛddhatara];

- See Chap. IX. Intro. rules.

- @[atiśāyane tamabiṣṭhanau | dvivacanavidhajo yaṣṣadoḥ tarabīyasunau | tarabīyasunau | tarabaṃpau dhaḥ] Pāṇ. 5. 3. 55. 57. 58; 1. 1. 22. When @[atiśaya] or excess of the one thing over many is to be shown @[tara] and @[tama] are the affixes used; and when out of two things one is to be separated as possessing some quality in excess @[tara] and @[īyasun] are affixed. @[tara] and @[tama] may also be added to verbs.
