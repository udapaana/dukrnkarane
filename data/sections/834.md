rule: §834
---

In the case of words expressing fear or protection from fear, that from which or whom the fear proceeds is put in the Ablative case; @[corād bibheti] 'is afraid of a thief'; @[bhīto raṇe śvetavāhānāt] 'I was afraid of the white-horsed one i.e., Arjuna'; @[svalpam api asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt] (Bhag. II, 40) 'even a little of this (kind of) piety saves one from great fear'; @[kapeḥ aghāśuḥ nādāt] (Bhatt. IX. 11.) 'were afraid of the roar of the monkey.'

(a) That from which one is kept off is also put in the Ablative; @[pāpāt vārayati] 'wards off from sin'; @[yavebhyaḥ gāṃ vārayati] 'keeps off the cow from barley.'
