(a) The following two words which are the names of two rivers are derived by means of this affix; @[vittir chalaṃ vidiḥ] from @[bhid] + @[kyap]; @[uñchayaty udakaṃ vṛkṣāṇām, uñch] + @[kyap]; see Rag. XI. 8. In other cases these roots take the affix @[tṛc]; @[bhettā], @[uñchitā].

(b) Similarly the words @[puṣyaḥ] and @[tiṣyaḥ]; both the names of the constellation Pushya, are derived from @[puṣ] and @[sidh] respectively with the affix @[kyap]; @[puṣyanty asmin arthāḥ puṣyaḥ, sidhyanty asmin sidhyaḥ].
