Obs.—The Bah. compounds are also further divided into two kinds; @[tadguṇasaṃjñānabahuvrīhiḥ] and @[atadguṇasaṃjñānabahuvrīhiḥ]. That in which the sense of the attributive member is also present is called Tadguṇasaṃjñāna, @[pītāmbaraṃ harim ānaya] is an instance of the first; here such a @[hariḥ] is meant as has the yellow silk garment actually on. @[citraṃ rākṣasaṃ ānaya] is of the other; here what is meant is @[rākṣasa] only and not his variegated cows.

- @[saptamyāḥ śiṣyate bahuvrīhau]. Pāṇ. II. 2. 35. In a Bah. the noun in the Loc. and an adjectival word are placed first; @[ata eva jñāpakāt vyādhikaraṇapadaḥ pūrvapadaṃ bhavati]. Sid. Kau.

† This is allowed by the Vārt. '@[saptamyupamānapūrvapadasyottarapadalopaḥ vaktavyaḥ]. In a Bah. comp. the word following a noun in the Loc. or an upamānapada (a noun denoting a standard of comparison) is dropped; so this ought to be properly analysed as @[candrasya kāntiḥ candrakāntiḥ candrasya kāntiḥ iva kāntiḥ yasya asau candrakāntiḥ]. But later grammarians, such as Vāmana, Bhaṭṭoji &c., have rejected this Vārt. altogether as of no practical value.
