rule: §580

The Par. terminations are weak and therefore occasion
@[guṇa] where it is permitted by Pāṇini's rules. The Ātm. terminations are strong and therefore occasion @[vṛddhi].

**Examples:**
- @[√ci] (to collect): Par. @[cināti], Ātm. @[cinute]
- @[√nī] (to lead): Par. @[nayati], Ātm. @[nayate]
- @[√kṛ] (to do): Par. @[karoti], Ātm. @[kurute]

*Note:* The strength of terminations affects the vowel gradation of the root according to the general principles of @[saṃdhi].
