\*With interrogative words such as @[kim], @[katara], @[katama], &c. the Potential or the Simple Future may be used when censure is implied (see § 937); @[kaḥ kataro vā enaṃ nindeta nindiṣyati vā] ।

(a) When wonder is implied the simple Future is used in preference to the Potential if the word @[yadi] be not used; @[āścaryaṃ yad andho harīṃ paśyati] it is a wonder that a blind man should see Hari; but @[āścaryaṃ yadi sa adhīyīta] it is wonder if he study.
