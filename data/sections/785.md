## § 785. The predicate may not always be a finite verb; but

§ 785.  The predicate may not always  be a  finite  verb;  but
a participle, or an adjective or a noun may take its place.

(a)  When a participle  is  used  as  the  predicate  it  must
agree with the subject in  number  and  gender;  @deva[स  वदन्कुदानं]
said that, @deva[स वदुक्तवती] she said that, @deva[तेषां कत्यमानि छिद्राति] their
bonds were cut  off,  @deva[कृतं  छत्तं]  the  work  is  done, @deva[छुता छिन्ना] the
creeper is cut, &c.

(b)  When an adjective or a noun is used  as  the  predicate,
a form of the roots @deva[अस्] or @deva[भू] may  be  used  with it  or  may be
omitted; the  adjective  used  predicatively  agrees  with  the
subject in number and gender;  words  like  @deva[आत्मनु],  @deva[पत्रं],  @deva[भावना],
@deva[स्थानु], @deva[प्रा] &c. retain  their  gender  and  number;  @deva[सुशुयुयुः  हुटुभुः] a
good servant is difficult to be  obtained,  @deva[सुप्रयुः  पित्युः  गवाल्ब्युयुव युच]
good sons are the object  of  his  father's  pride,  @deva[समदुः  पदुः  पुस्तो]
riches are the abode  of  miseries,  @deva[स  तु  तेषां  अभिमानवर्धनो भवति]
in these cases the verb  agrees  with  the  subject  in  number and
not with the noun  used  predicatively;  @deva[सत्पुरुदु  आयुयुर्वो  पदं  सन्ति]
and not @deva[अस्ति], &c.
