The predicate may not always be a finite verb; but a participle, or an adjective or a noun may take its place.

(a) When a participle is used as the predicate it must agree with the subject in number and gender; @[sa tad uktavān] he said that, @[sā tad uktavatī] she said that, @[teṣāṃ bandhanāni chinnāni] their bonds were cut off, @[kāryaṃ kṛtam] the work is done, @[latā chinnā] the creeper is cut; &c.

(b) When an adjective or a noun is used as the predicate, a form of the roots @[as] or @[bhū] may be used with it or may be omitted; the adjective used predicatively agrees with the subject in number and gender; words like @[āspadam], @[pātram], @[bhājanam], @[sthānam], @[padam] &c. retain their gender and number; @[subhṛtyaḥ durlabhaḥ] a good servant is difficult to be obtained, @[suputraḥ pituḥ āspadam] a good son is the object of his father's pride, @[sampadaḥ padam āpadām] riches are the abode of miseries, @[sa tu tasyā abhiprāyabhūmiḥ] &c. in these cases the verb agrees with the subject in number and not with the noun used predicatively; @[sampadaḥ āpadaḥ padam santi] and not @[asti], &c.
