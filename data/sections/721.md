@[jṛ] takes this affix with the negative particle prefixed to it and forms @[ajaryam] 'what cannot grow old' but this must qualify @[saṅgatam] 'friendship', @[yena saṅgatam ajaryaṃ kṛtaṃ tādṛg aniruddham] Bhaṭṭi. VI. 53. In @[saṅgatam ajaryaṃ jarasā upaviṣṭaṃ mṛgaṃ saṃsārayāmaḥ] Rag. XVIII. 7, the word @[saṅgatam] must be considered as understood. If it does not qualify @[saṅgata], it will take the affix @[yu]; as @[ajariṇī striyaḥ].
