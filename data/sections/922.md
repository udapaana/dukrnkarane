With the words @[prāk], @[tāvat] and others having a similar sense, the Present is sometimes used in the sense of the Future perfect; @[prāk tvāṃ na paśyati tāvat uraṃ apasara] before he sees you, move away (before he shall have seen you, &c.).

(b) † With the particles @[purā] and @[yāvat] the Present has the sense of the Future when certainty is indicated; @[yāvat te sādhayituṃ ceṣṭe artham] (Ragh. V. 25.) I will endeavour to accomplish your object. @[purā saptadvīpāṃ jayati vasudhām] (Śāk. VII. 33) he will conquer the earth consisting of seven continents. @[purā cakṣuṣe tvaṃ ca dhāma]. Kir. VIII. 8.
