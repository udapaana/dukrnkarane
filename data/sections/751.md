When a root is compounded with one or more prepositions or words prefixed to verbs like prepositions, the indeclinable participle is formed by affixing @[ya] immediately to it; the @[a] is changed to @[ā] after a short radical vowel (even when it combines with the final vowel of a preposition to a long vowel); e. g.

@[dā] with @[ā]—@[ādāya] @[i] c. @[pra]—@[pretya] @[ci] with @[nis]—@[niścitya] @[kṛ] with @[sam]—@[saṃskṛtya]
@[ji] with @[parā]—@[parājitya] @[kṛ] with @[tiras]—@[tiraskṛtya] @[nī] with @[vi]—@[vinīya] @[bhid] with @[nis]—@[nirbhidya]
@[gai] with @[anu]—@[anugāya] @[plut] with @[ud]—@[utplutya] @[i] with @[adhi]—@[adhītya] &c. &c. &c.
