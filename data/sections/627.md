rule: §627

There are two kinds of frequentative bases derived from roots; both are formed by a peculiar reduplication of the root; but in one the affix @[ya] (@[yaṅ]) is added to the root before reduplication takes place, and the base is conjugated in the Ātm. alone, in the other the affix @[ya] is dropped (@[yaṅluk]) and the base is conjugated in Parasm. only (in the Ātm. also, according to some grammarians). It will be convenient to call the one the Ātm. frequentative, and the other the Parasm. frequentative.
