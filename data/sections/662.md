rule: §662

When the sense of @[akartavyatikāra] i.e. doing what is not proper for one to do, or the exchange of duties is to be implied, the Atm. is used, @[brāhmaṇaḥ sasyāni vartrāyuṇīte] 'the Brāhmaṇa reaps corn' (which is the work of a Śūdra and not his); @[dharmaḥ vyatiṣṭate] 'the religious duty is changed' (as when a Śūdra discharges the duties enjoined upon a Vaiśya, &c.); @[vyatihrante rājānaḥ] 'the kings exchange blows.'

(a) But verbs implying motion, or meaning to kill, the roots @[has] and other similar roots do not take the Atm. even when an exchange of action is implied, @[vyatiricchanti], @[vyatiśranti]; @[vyatihasanti], @[vyatijighnaṇti].
