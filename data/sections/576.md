## § 576. Roots of 8th Class Dropping Nasal

Roots of the 8th class ending in @deva[न्] or @deva[ण्] drop their nasal and substitute optionally @deva[धात्] and @deva[त] for the terminations @deva[ष्ठाः] and @deva[ष्ट] of the 2nd and 3rd person sing. Atm. @deva[तन्] lengthens its vowel after dropping @deva[न्].
