When a compound has for its second member a word denoting a limb of the body of an animal and having no conjunct consonant preceding its final vowel, the fem. is formed by the addition of @[ā] or @[ī]; @[bahūromasī-mā] 'a woman having abundant hair;' @[sukeśā-śī], @[suromā-mī]; but @[suguḍphā] having beautiful ankles; @[sustanī] or @[sustanā] (@[strī vā pratimā vā]); @[surūpā śālā] 'an edifice with a beautiful front'.

(c) If the word, denoting the limb, however, be one of the words @[kroḍa], @[jaṭā], @[kakud], @[ukhā], @[śikhā], @[vāla], @[roma], @[aśru], @[sthūlā], @[karṇa] &c. or have more than two syllables, the fem. is formed in @[ā] alone; @[kalyāṇakroḍā] (@[kalyāṇīkroḍā] Sid. Kau.), @[pṛthujaghanā], having large hips; @[suvedikā], &c.

(d) Also when the first member is one of @[su], @[saha], or @[viṣa-sama], the fem. is formed in @[ā] necessarily; @[sunāsā], @[sahanāsā], @[viṣa-samanāsikā], @[samanāsikā] &c.
