§ 235. When the second member of a Tat. Comp. is a root—noun derived from a root which takes a particular Krit affix by virtue of the presence of the first member, it is called an Upapada Tat.; as @deva[कुम्भं करोतीति कुम्भकारः] 'a potter,' so @deva[सामगायतीति सामगः] 'one who chants a verse of the Sāman Veda;' @deva[मांसं कामयती मांसकामा] 'desirous of meat;' similarly @deva[अश्वक्रीतं] (@deva[अश्वेन क्रीता]) 'bought for a horse', @deva[कच्छपी] 'a female tortoise,' &c. The noun prefixed to the last member, such as @deva[कुम्भ], is called an upapada.*

N. B. The latter member of such compounds must neither be the conjugated form of a root nor a separate verbal derivative i. e. formed independently of the last member; e. g. @deva[पयोधर] is not an Upapada Tat., as the word @deva[घर] can be independently formed; it is a Gen. Tat. @deva[परतीति घरः पयसां घरः पयोधरः] 'a cloud' or 'the female breast.'
