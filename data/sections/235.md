rule: §235

When the second member of a Tat. Comp. is a root-noun derived from a root which takes a particular @[kṛt] affix by virtue of the presence of the first member, it is called an @[upapada] Tat.; as @[kumbhaṃ karotīti kumbhakāraḥ] 'a potter,' so @[sāma gāyatīti sāmagaḥ] 'one who chants a verse of the Sāman veda,' @[māṃsaṃ kāmayati māṃsakāmā] 'desirous of meat'; similarly @[aśvakreyī] (@[aśvena krītā]) 'bought for a horse', @[kacchapī] 'a female tortoise,' &c. The noun prefixed to the last member, such as @[kumbha], is called an @[upapada].*

N. B.— The latter member of such compounds must neither be the conjugated form of a root nor a separate verbal derivative i.e. formed independently of the last member; e.g. @[payodharaḥ] is not an @[upapada] Tat., as the word @[dhara] can be independently formed; it is a Gen. Tat. @[dharatīti dharaḥ payaḥ dharaḥ payodharaḥ] 'a cloud' or 'the female breast.'
