The terminations used to form derivative bases in Sanskrit are distinguished into two classes: (1) @[Kṛt] (@deva[कृत्]) or Primary Affixes and (2) @[Taddhita] (@deva[तद्धित]) or Secondary affixes.

@[Kṛt] are those affixes that are added to verbs, and the Nominal Bases formed by their means are called **Primary Nominal Bases**; while @[Taddhita] affixes are those that are added to substantives, primary or derived from roots, and the bases formed with them are called **Secondary Nominal Bases**.
