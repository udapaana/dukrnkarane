## § 877. "When the participle agrees with a subject different

§ 877.  "When  the  participle  agrees  with  a  subject  different
from  the  subject  of  the  verb,  the  phrase  is  said  to  be  in  the  abso-
lute  construction.  "  Bain.

In  English,  the  Nominative  is  used  as  an  Absolute  case;  in
Sanskrit the Genitive and the Locative are so used. The English-
Nominative  Absolute  ought,  therefore,  to  be  translated  by  the
Sanskrit Locative  Absolute.  When  the  Absolute  Construction
is  to  be  used,  the  subject  of  the  participle  must  be  put  in  the
Genitive  or  the  Locative  case  and  the  participle  made  to  agree
with  it  in  gender,  number  and  case.

N.  B.  When  the  subject  or  object  of  the  principal  sentence  is
the  same  as  that  of  the  participial  phrase,  the  absolute  construc-
tion  should  not  be  used;  as  @deva[अयुयोयुयुयो  तिवुत्तुयो  रायुनो  राज्युयुयुकुरुतुदुट्]  and
not @deva[अयुयोयुयुयुयुं निवुत्तुनं रायुनै युङु]  &c.;  @deva[आगुतेयुयो  विवुयुत्युयो  दुक्तुयुत्युयुयुयुरुच्युच्युयुट्]
and  not  @deva[आगुतेयुयुङु  निषुयुदुयुट् तेयुयुयुः]  &c.
