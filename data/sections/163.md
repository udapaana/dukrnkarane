rule: §163

The ordinals from @[eka], @[dvi], @[tri], @[catur] and @[ṣaṣ] are irregularly formed. The ordinal from other numerals up to @[daśan] inclusive are formed by dropping the final @[an] and adding @[ma] and after @[daśan] up to @[pañcāśat] by simply dropping the @[t]. The ordinals from @[ṣaṣṭi] and above are formed by adding @[tama] or by dropping the @[ti] of @[viṃśati] and the final consonant of the rest; the compound numerals, in this latter case, change the final vowel to @[a], while the simple ones ending in a vowel e.g. @[saptati], @[aśīti] and @[navati] form their ordinals in the first way only; e.g. @[ekaṣaṣṭaḥ] or @[ekaṣaṣṭitamaḥ], but @[ekasaptatitamaḥ] only. @[śata] has invariably @[śatatama].
