§ 163. The ordinals from @deva[एक], @deva[द्वि], @deva[त्रि], @deva[चतुर्] and @deva[षष्] † are
irregularly formed. The ordinal from other numerals up to
@deva[दशन्] inclusive are formed by dropping the final @deva[न्] and adding @deva[म]
and after @deva[दशन्] up to @deva[नवदशन्] by simply dropping the @deva[न्]. The
ordinals from @deva[विंशति] ‡ above are formed by adding @deva[तम] or by
dropping the @deva[ति] of @deva[विंशति] and the final consonant of the rest;
the compound numerals in this latter case change the final
vowel to @deva[अ], while the simple ones ending in a vowel i. e. @deva[षष्टि]
