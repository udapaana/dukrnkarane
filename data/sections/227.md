Words ending in the terminations @[tavya], @[anīya], @[ya] and @[tulya] and words having a similar meaning, may be compounded with any @[subanta] not importing a particular kind; e.g. @deva[भोज्योदनः] 'any hot eatable', @deva[तुल्यश्वेतः] 'of a similar white colour', @deva[तुल्यकृष्णः], &c.; but @deva[भोज्यः ओदनः] as the latter word refers to a kind of food here.
