rule: §158

When a pronominal word is used as the subordinate member of a compound, or is at the end of an Inst. Tat., or of a sentence having the sense of the Inst. Tat., or at the end of a Dwandwa, it is not declined like a pronoun; e.g. @deva[अतिक्रान्तः] @deva[सर्वम्] @[atiśarvaḥ], @[tasmai atiśarvāya] and not @[sarvasmai]; so @[atrakatare chalam]; @[māsapūrvāya] or @[māsena pūrvāya] and not @[māsapūrvasmai]; @[varṇāśrametarāṇām] &c.; in the case of a Dwandwa comp., however, it is optionally declined like a pronoun in the Nom. plu., as @[varṇāśrametarāṇi] or @[varṇāśrametarāḥ].
