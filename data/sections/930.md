## § 930. The Aorist - General Definition

The Aorist simply expresses past action indefinitely, i.e. without reference to any particular time (@deva[भूतमात्रे लुङ्] @[bhūtamātre luṅ]):

**Examples:**

- @deva[कोरौदट् चैकलिङ्दमात्रमसु यिनूयुयरितसुर्युतु बन्युदु । ययरे यद्युगैरास्युरु नोतः युट्युयुयूतं त्युयुनैयुयुनुरियुकु] @[korauḍaṭ caikalinḍamātrāsu...] (Bhaṭṭi. I. 2) 'He studied the Vedas, offered sacrifices to the gods, satisfied his departed ancestors, honoured his relatives, subdued the collection of six (i.e. the six passions), took delight in politics and totally annihilated his enemies.'

The Aorist, however, properly denotes **immediate action** or one done during the course of the present day. "It is similar to the English present Perfect," remarks Dr. Bhāṇḍārkar, "which the student will remember defines an action as having happened in a portion of time which is not yet expired; it brings past action in connection with the present time."

- @deva[अवर्षीत्] @[avarṣīt] it rained to-day
