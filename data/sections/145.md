Reciprocity is expressed by the repetition of the pronominal adjectives @[anya], @[itara] and @[para]; e.g. @[anyonya], @[itaretaraḥ] and @[paraspara]. These are generally used in the sing. and also adverbially e.g. @[parasparaṃ spṛhaṇīyobhayaṃ] &c. (Rag. VII, 14); @[parasparaṃ vivadante] &c. They are more commonly used as the first members of compounds; as @[anyonyadoṣodbhāvanād] &c. (Ku. I, 44); @[itaretarayogāḥ] (Śi. i. 24.) &c.
