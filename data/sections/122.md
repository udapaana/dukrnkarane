## § 122. ( 1 ) @deva[दिशि] to point, rule. This root gives rise to

§ 122. ( 1 ) @deva[दिशि] to point, rule. This root gives rise to
three nominal bases differing in gender; the mas. base is @deva[दिश्]
( Pan. III. 2. 61 ; @deva[वा०] III. 2. 70 ) which forms its nom. sing. after
the analogy of @deva[युज्], viz. @deva[दिक् ॥] Thus @deva[वदिजः], @deva[प्रदिजः] &c. @deva[॥] The word
occurs in the sense of 'Lord' or 'ruler,' being a compound and
having a base in @deva[अच्] ( Pan. VI. 1. 168 ).
