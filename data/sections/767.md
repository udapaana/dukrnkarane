rule: §767

The Gerund of the roots @[dṛś] and @[vid] is compounded with their objects and expresses totality; @[kanyādṛgdham vṛṇīte] 'chooses as many girls as he sees, i.e. all of them,' @[yat yat paśyati bhojayati, yam yam brāhmaṇam jānāti labhate vā smarati vā tam sarvam bhojayati] (Sid. Kau.) 'he feeds every brāhmaṇa that he knows or comes across or remembers i.e. all of them.'

(a) The gerunds of @[vid] 'to get' and @[jīv] 'to live' are joined with @[yāvat] in the same sense; @[yāvadvidham bhukte] 'eats what he gets.'

(b) With the words @[caram] and @[udara] the gerund of @[pū] is used; @[carapūram stṛṇāti]; @[udarapūram bhukte] 'eats so as to fill his belly.'
