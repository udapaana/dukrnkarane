Special rules of @[sandhi] of the finals of roots and the initial letters of terminations:—

(1) The ending @deva[अ] of a root takes its @[vṛddhi] substitute when followed by a consonantal strong termination; as @deva[अद्] + @deva[अन्ति] = @deva[अदन्ति].

(2) The final @deva[इ] or @deva[उ], short or long, of a root is changed to @deva[इय्] or @deva[उव्] before a vowel weak termination.

(3) The ending @deva[ह्] of roots is changed to @deva[ध्] when followed by any consonant, except a nasal or a semivowel, or by nothing; and that of roots beginning with @deva[द्] to @deva[त्] under the same circumstances.

(4) The initial @deva[ध्] or @deva[भ्] of a termination is changed to @deva[ब्] after a soft aspirate (4th letter of a class).

(5) @deva[स्] or @deva[ष्] followed by @deva[ध्] is changed to @deva[द्ध्].

(6) @deva[त्] and @deva[न्] when followed by a consonant are changed to the nasal of the class to which the following consonant belongs, and to an @[anusvāra] when followed by @deva[श्], @deva[ष्], @deva[स्] or @deva[ह्].

(7) The ending @deva[इ] of a root, short or long, not preceded by a conjunct consonant is changed to @deva[य्] before vowel weak terminations, when the base consists of more than one syllable.

(8) The ending @deva[द्] of a root is optionally changed to @deva[ट्] or @[visarga] in the Imperfect second pers. sing. and the ending @deva[ध्] to @deva[त्] or @deva[द्] before the termination @deva[ध्वम्] and optionally before @deva[व].

(9) When a conjunct consonant having @deva[त्] or @deva[द्] for its first member is at the end of a word or is followed by a consonant except a nasal or a semivowel, the @deva[त्] or @deva[द्] is dropped.

N. B.—The usual @[sandhi] rules and those given in the 2nd and 3rd Chapters should be observed.
