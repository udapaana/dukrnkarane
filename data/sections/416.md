## § 416. Special Sandhi Rules for 2nd, 3rd and 7th Classes

### Second, Third and Seventh Classes

Special rules of Sandhi of the finals of roots and the initial letters of terminations:—

(1) The ending @deva[उ] @[u] of a root takes its Vṛddhi substitute when followed by a consonantal strong termination; as @deva[उ + सि = नौति] @[u + si = nauti].

(2) The final @deva[ऋ] @[ṛ] or @deva[उ] @[u], short or long, of a root is changed to @deva[अर्] @[ar] or @deva[उर्] @[ur] before a vowel weak termination.

(3) The ending @deva[ऋ] @[ṛ] of roots is changed to @deva[र्] @[r] when followed by any consonant, except a nasal or a semivowel, or by nothing; and that of roots beginning with @deva[ऋ] @[ṛ] to @deva[घ] @[gh] under the same circumstances.

(4) The initial @deva[द्] @[d] or @deva[ध्] @[dh] of a termination is changed to @deva[ध्] @[dh] after a soft aspirate (4th letter of a class).

(5) @deva[क्] @[k] or @deva[ग्] @[g] followed by @deva[ह] @[h] is changed to @deva[क्] @[k].

(6) @deva[न] @[n] and @deva[म] @[m] when followed by a consonant are changed to the nasal of the class to which the following consonant belongs, and to an anusvāra when followed by @deva[श] @[ś], @deva[ष] @[ṣ], @deva[स] @[s] or @deva[ह] @[h].

(7) The ending @deva[र] @[r] of a root, short or long, not preceded by a conjunct consonant is changed to @deva[ऊ] @[ū] before vowel weak terminations, when the base consists of more than one syllable.

(8) The ending @deva[र] @[r] of a root is optionally changed to @deva[त] @[t] or Visarga in the Imperfect second pers. sing. and the ending @deva[ऊ] @[ū] to @deva[ऊ] @[ū] or @deva[ई] @[ī] before the termination @deva[ऊ] @[ū] and optionally before @deva[म] @[m].

(9) When a conjunct consonant having @deva[ङ] @[ṅ] or @deva[क्] @[k] for its first member is at the end of a word or is followed by a consonant except a nasal or a semivowel, the @deva[ङ] @[ṅ] or @deva[क्] @[k] is dropped.

**N. B.**— The usual Sandhi rules i. e. those given in the 2nd and 3rd Chapters should be observed.
