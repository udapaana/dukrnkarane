The base of the roots of the 2nd group of Conjugation classes undergoes many modifications with regard to which the terminations are divided into sets, one set is called 'strong', the other 'weak'. The base taking the strong terminations may be called 'The strong base', and that taking the weak ones 'The weak base'.

(a) The strong terminations are:—

The singulars of all persons of the Present and the Imperfect, the third person singular and all numbers of the first person of the imperative, in the @[parasmaipada], and all numbers of the first person of the imperative in the @[ātmanepada].

(b) The rest are weak.
