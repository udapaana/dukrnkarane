## § 896. The past passive participle is very frequently used to

§ 896. The past passive participle is very frequently used to
supply the place of a verb, sometimes in conjunction with the
auxiliary verbs @deva[अस्] and @deva[भू]. The past passive participle agrees
adjectivally with its gender, number and case, the
agent being put in the Instrumental, while the past active
participle is treated exactly like the verb in the past tense; @deva[तेन
कुयुर्युं छुतं] by him the work was done; @deva[तेनं युन्युयुयुनुति छिन्नुयुति] by him
the bonds were cut; @deva[आतिदुयूयूतिनं देव्युयु याविरुणु] I am commanded
by queen Dūtikā; @deva[तेनं कृतं कुयुयुयुरु] he did the work; @deva[रायु देयुयुयुडु
हुतुयूरु] Rāma killed the Rākshasas; @deva[छुत्तुयुयूयूते नायुयुरीरुर्णों] thou
didst never despise me, &c.
