The past passive participle is very frequently used to supply the place of a verb; sometimes in conjunction with the auxiliary verbs @[as] and @[bhū]. The past passive participle agrees adjectively with the object in gender, number and case, the agent being put in the Instrumental, while the past active participle is treated exactly like the verb in the past tense; @[tena kāryaṃ kṛtam] by him the work was done; @[tena bandhanāni chinnam] by him the bonds were cut; @[ādiṣṭāsmi devyā dhāriṇyā] I am commanded by queen Dhāriṇī; @[sa kāryaṃ kṛtavān] he did the work; @[rāmaḥ daitya rākṣasān hatavān] Rāma killed the Rākṣasas; @[tvayā akṣe na avadṛṣṭam aham] thou didst never despise me, &c.
