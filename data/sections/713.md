The final @[aya] of roots of the tenth class and of causals, the final @[a] of Ātm. Freq. Bases, when the @[a] is preceded by a vowel and the whole @[ya] when it is preceded by a consonant, are dropped before @[anīya]. To desiderative bases it is added without any change e.g.

@[kath]—@[kathanīya] what must, or ought to be told.

@[cur]—@[coraṇīya] ,,,, stolen.

@[bodhaya] cau. of @[budh]—@[bodhanīya] ,, " made to know.

@[bodhate] Ātm. Freq. Base of @[budh]—@[bodhanīya] ,, " known frequently

@[dhuvīya]—Ātm. freq. Base of @[dhu]—@[dhoyanīya] what must or ought to be frequently washed.

**Note:**
- The @[a] of @[guh] is changed to @[o] against § 712.
- The @[i] of @[bhid] is lengthened instead of being Guṇated before a strong termination beginning with a vowel.
