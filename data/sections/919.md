Besides the general sense given above the Present tense in Sanskrit has the following senses:—

(a) It is sometimes used in the sense of 'immediate futurity,' @[kadā gacchasi] when wilt thou go? @[eṣa gacchāmi] Here I go (i. e. shall go); @[ūrdhvaṃ muhūrtād iha utsādi] I shall die an hour after.

(b) It may also be used to denote an action which is recently completed, @[kathaṃ tvaṃ nagarād āgataḥ] when didst thou come from the city? @[eṣa āgacchāmi] Here I come (have come just now).

(c) In narrations it is used for the Past tense, @[gṛdhro brūte] the vulture says, 'who art thou'?

(d) Sometimes it is used to denote a habitual or repeated action; @[payodadhena asau jīvati].
