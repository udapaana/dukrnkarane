## § 942. Simple Future for Wonder

When the idea of wonder is to be expressed and the words @deva[काच्] @[kāc], @deva[मान] @[māna] and @deva[यदि] @[yadi] do not occur in a sentence, the Simple Future should be used:

@deva[परान्धन्योऽधन्योऽपि हरिं पश्यति हरिं पक्ष्यति] @[parāndhunyo'dhunyo'pi hariṃ paśyati hariṃ pakṣyati] it is a wonder that a blind man sees Hari.

**(a)** The Simple Future is also used when the particles @deva[नु] @[nu] and @deva[आपि] @[āpi] expressing a doubt are used:

- @deva[नु दण्डः पतिष्यति] @[nu daṇḍaḥ patiṣyati] will the stick fall?
- @deva[आपि कापारामति द्वारं] @[āpi kāpārāmati dvāraṃ] will he close the door?

**(b)** This Future is also used when the particle @deva[अहम्] @[aham] meaning sure or able is used:

@deva[अहं हतुं निश्चय] @[ahaṃ hatuṃ niścaya] Kṛishṇa is sure or able to kill the elephant.
