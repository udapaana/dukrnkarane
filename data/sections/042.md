@[ṣaḥ] belonging to a substitute (@[ādeśa]) or a termination (@[pratyaya]) and not at the end of a grammatical form is changed to @[ṣaḥ] when preceded by any vowel except @[a] or @[ā], a semivowel, a letter of the guttural class or @[ha]; e.g. @[rāme] + @[su] = @[rāmeṣu]; but @[śasva] as @[sa] is preceded by @[śa], @[subhyaḥ] @[gṛhebhyaḥ] etc., as @[sa] belongs to the word @[sup]. This change takes place even if an @[anusvāra] substituted for @[ma], a @[visarga] or @[ṣa] or @[sa] intervene; e.g. @[dhanus] + @[si] = @[dhanuḥṣi] nom. pl. of @[dhanus] neu. a bow. @[pipadiṣ] + @[su] = @[pipadiṣṣu].
