Adjectives in the Comparative degree are used with the Ablative; @[abhivṛddheḥ rakṣā śreyasī] protection (of one's subjects) is better than aggrandizement. @[arjunād yudhiṣṭhiro jyāyān] Yudhiṣṭhira was older than Arjuna.

(a) Sometimes the comparative is used with the Instrumental, @[prāṇaiḥ priyataraḥ] dearer than life. See also § 863 Note.
