## § 887. Adjectives in the Comparative degree are used with

§ 887 Adjectives in the Comparative degree are used with
the Ablative; @deva[वर्नुयुयुयुरुणों श्रेयुः] protection (of one's subjects) is
better than aggrandizement. @deva[अर्जुनैनुयुयुयुवुयुयुयुरो ज्युयुयुयुयुट्] Udhisthira
was older than Arjuna.

(:) Sometimes the comparative is used with the Instra-
mental; @deva[प्राणैं दियुयुरुः] dearer than life. See also § 863 Note.
