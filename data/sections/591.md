Formation of base:—

(a) @[ya] is added to the root, which is weak i.e. no Guṇa or Vṛddhi substitute takes place before it; @[nī]—@[nīya], @[bhid]—@[bhidya]

(b) Before @[ya] roots undergo the same changes as they do before the Par. terminations of the benedictive; @[ji]—@[jīya], @[i]—@[iya], @[smṛ]—@[smarya], @[ṛ]—@[arya], @[kṛ]—@[kriya], @[pṝ]—@[pūrya], @[vadh]—@[vadhya], (@[nind]—@[nindya]), @[vac]—@[ucya], @[brah]—@[brahya], &c.

(c) The final @[ā] (original or substituted) of @[dā] 'to give,' @[de], @[dhe], @[mā], @[sthā], @[pā], @[hā] 'to drink,' @[so] @[pā] @[hā] 'to abandon,' is changed to @[ī]; in other cases it remains unchanged; @[dā] and @[dhe]—@[dīya], @[ge]—@[gīya], @[hā]—@[hīya]; but @[chā] 'to cut, to purify'—@[chāya], @[jñā]—@[jñāya], @[psā]—@[psāya].
