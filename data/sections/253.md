## § 253. —Names of directions may form a Bahuvrihi compound and signify the point of direction between them;

§ 253. —Names of directions may form a Bahuvrihi compound and signify the point of direction between them; @deva[द्रष्टैपत्स्याः पूर्वस्याश्च दिशोऽन्तराल्लं द्राक्षिणपूर्वां]; so @deva[उत्तरपूर्वं], &c. But if the words so compounded are not the names of quarters, no compound is possible; as @deva[ऐन्द्रागश्र कौवेयाश्रान्तराल्लै तिङ्क] the point between the East and the North, and not @deva[ऐन्द्राकौवेरौ] as these are not the names of the Eastern and Northern quarters.
