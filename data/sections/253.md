rule: §253

Names of directions may form a @[bahuvrīhi] compound and signify the point of direction between them; @[dakṣiṇāyāḥ pūrvāyāś ca dijoḥ antarālaṃ dakṣiṇapūrvā]; so @[uttarapūrvā], &c. But if the words so compounded are not the names of quarters, no compound is possible; as @[prācīṃ ca kauberīṃ ca antarāle dik] the point between the East and the North, and not @[prākkauvberī] as these are not the names of the Eastern and Northern quarters.
