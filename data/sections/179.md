@[Vṛtti] (@deva[वृत्तिः]) is the general term for any complex formation in Sanskrit requiring explanation or resolution. These @[vṛtti]s are five in number; viz. @[kṛdanta] or the formation of words from roots by primary affixes; @[taddhitānta] or the formation of derivative bases from nouns by secondary affixes; @[dhātujānta] or the formation of derivative verbs from primitive roots; @[samāsānta] or the formation of a compound word by the composition of several words; and @[ekasaṃjñānta] or the composition of words in which one of several nouns generally alike in form is retained. The first three will be treated in their proper places. We will treat of the last two in this Chapter.
