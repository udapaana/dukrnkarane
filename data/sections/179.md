## § 179. Vṛitti ( @deva[वृत्ति] ) is the general term for any complex

§ 179.  Vṛitti ( @deva[वृत्ति] ) is the general term for any complex
formation in Sanskrit requiring explanation or resolution. These
Vṛittis are five in number ; viz.  @deva[कृदृत्ति] or the formation of words
from roots by primary affixes ; @deva[तद्धितवृत्ति] or the formation of.
derivative bases from nouns by secondary affixes ; @deva[धातुवृत्ति] or the
formation of derivative verbs from primitive roots ; @deva[समासवृत्ति]
or the formation of a compound word by the composition of
several words ; and @deva[एकशेषवृत्ति] or the composition of words in
which one of several nouns generally alike in form is retained.
The first three will be treated in their proper places.  We will
treat of the last two in this Chapter.
