@[t] is substituted for the ending @[d] of a root when followed by any non-conjugational termination beginning with @[s].

- These terminations, it will be seen, are obtained by adding those of the Present to @[sya] with its @[a] lengthened before initial @[m] and @[v], and dropped before a vowel.

† These are obtained similarly by adding the terminations of the Imperfect to @[sya] the usual rules of @[sandhi] being observed.
