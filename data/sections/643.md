rule: §643

The consonant @[v] and the syllable @[as] are inserted between any nominal stem and the affix @[ya]; @[madhu] @[svam icchati] @[madhusyati] or @[madhvasyati] 'he wishes for honey'; so @[vasyati], @[dadhyasyati], &c. Final @[a] is dropped before @[as]; @[putrasvatī].

(a) @[as] is inserted after @[vṛṣa] and @[aśva] when the sense to be conveyed is that of longing for them, after @[kṣīra] and @[lavaṇa] when the one is desired to be drunk and the other to be licked; @[vṛṣasyati gauḥ] 'the cow longs for the ox,' @[aśvasyati vaḍavā] 'the mare longs for the horse;' @[kṣīrasyati bālaḥ] 'the child desires to drink,' @[lavaṇasyati uṣṭraḥ] 'the camel wishes for licking the salt.' But @[vṛṣīyati] 'he desires to have a bull,' @[aśvīyati] 'he wishes for a horse,' @[kṣīrīyati], @[lavaṇīyati].
