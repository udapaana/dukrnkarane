Roots ending in @[ā], and those ending in a consonant take the affix @[ṇyat] (@[ya]) in the same sense as @[kyap]. Before this affix the ending @[ū] and @[jñū] of a root are changed to @[o] and @[g] respectively and the final vowel and the penultimate @[a] take Vṛddhi substitute; any other penultimate vowel generally takes Guṇa.
