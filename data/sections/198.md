## § 198. Arrangement Rules for Dvandva Compounds

The following rules should be observed in arranging the various members of a Dvandva Compound:

### (a) Words Ending in @deva[ङ] or @deva[ण] First

A word ending in @deva[ङ] @[ṅ] or @deva[ण] @[ṇ] should be placed first, and when there are more than one of such words one of these should be placed first, the rest being arranged according to the will of the speaker or writer.

Examples: @deva[हरिहरौ] @[hariharau], @deva[हरिहरजगन्नाथाः] @[hariharajagannāthāḥ]

### (b) Vowel-Initial and @deva[अ]-Ending Words Precede

Words beginning with a vowel and ending in @deva[अ] @[a] ought to precede others.

Example: @deva[अम्बरीशाः] @[ambarīśāḥ] or @deva[ईशाम्बराः] @[īśāmbarāḥ]

This rule should have preference even over the above rule in case both would be simultaneously applicable: @deva[ईशांगौ] @[īśāṅgau]

### (c) Fewer Syllables First

A word that has fewer syllables should be placed first.

See also § 199 for exceptions and special cases.
