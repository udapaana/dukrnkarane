Monosyllabic roots, having a short @deva[अ] for their penultimate, change it to @deva[ए] and drop the reduplicative syllable before the weak terminations and before @deva[थ] when it takes @deva[इ], provided their initial letter undergoes no change in the reduplication, e.g. @[pat] 1st dual @[papat + iva = pet + iva = petiva], @[petitha] 2 sing., etc. @[śakritha] 2. sing. of @[kram], but @[nanditha] 2nd dual of @[nad] as the @deva[अ] here is prosodially long.

Exceptions:—Roots beginning with @deva[य] and the roots @[svap] and @[vac].
