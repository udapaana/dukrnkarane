The first vowel of a root together with the initial consonant, if any, is reduplicated i.e. doubled, as @deva[पठ्] = @deva[पप्ठ्], @deva[उज्झ्] = @deva[उउज्झ्], &c. after reduplication.

Note—The first syllable of a reduplicated root is called 'the reduplicative syllable'; e.g. the first @deva[प] in @deva[पप्ठ्], or first @deva[उ] in @deva[उउज्झ्].
