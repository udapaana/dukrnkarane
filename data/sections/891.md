§ 891. All declinable participles in Sanskrit partake of the
nature of adjectives i e, they agree with the nouns they qualify
in gender, number, and case. The participles often discharge
the functions of verbs. They are largely employed to take the
place of the Past and Future tenses and more especially of
passive verbs. When so employed they follow the same rules
of syntax as are laid down for nouns from which they
are derived.

PRESENT PARTICIPLES.
