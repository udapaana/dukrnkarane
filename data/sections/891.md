All declinable participles in Sanskrit partake of the nature of adjectives i.e., they agree with the nouns they qualify in gender, number, and case. The participles often discharge the functions of verbs. They are largely employed to take the place of the Past and Future tenses and more especially of passive verbs. When so employed they follow the same rules of syntax as are laid down for the roots from which they are derived.
