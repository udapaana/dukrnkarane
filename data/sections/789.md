rule: §789

When an adjective qualifies two or more substantives it agrees with them in their combined number; when the substantives differ in gender, the adjective will be masculine when the substantives are masculine and feminine, and neuter when they are masculine, feminine and neuter @[rājā rājñī ca stutyacaritau staḥ] the king and his queen are of laudable conduct; @[dharmaḥ kāmaś ca tapaś ca krīḍā krodhaḥ sukhaṃ vayaḥ arthād etāni sarvāṇi pravarttiṣyante na saṃśayaḥ] fulfilment of duty, satisfaction of desires, pride, anger, happiness and long life; all these proceed undoubtedly from wealth.

(a) Sometimes the adjective takes the gender of the majority of the substantives; @[vṛddhau ca mātāpitarau sādhvī bhāryā kumārakaḥ | mānyāni caiva sarvāṇi bharttavyāni manur abravīt] aged parents, a good wife and a young son should be maintained even by doing a hundred foul deeds; so has Manu spoken (laid down).

- @[nipātena abhihite karma na vibhaktiparigaṇanasya prāyikatvāt] | Viman.

(b) And sometimes it takes the gender and number of the substantive nearest to it when the particle @[ca] is used; @[vamanaḥ kalahaḥ kaṇḍūḥ sevyamānā ca vardhate] ejection, quarrel and an itching sensation prevail all the more they are attended to; @[yasya sauryeṇa kṛtino vayaṃ ca bhuvanāni ca (kṛtāni)] by whose valour we have become happy and so have the three worlds.
