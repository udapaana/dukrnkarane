## § 246. Bahuvrihi or The Attributive Compounds

### III. BAHUVRIHI OR THE ATTRIBUTIVE COMPOUNDS.

A Bahuvrihi compound consists of two or more nouns in apposition to each other the attributive member being placed first and denotes or refers to something else than what is expressed by its members. It generally attributes that which is expressed by its second member, determined or modified by what is denoted by its first member, to something denoted by neither of the two; e. g, @deva[महाबाहुः] 'one whose arm is great;' @deva[पीताम्बरः] 'one whose garment is yellow.' When dissolved it must have the pronoun @deva[यद्] in any one of the oblique cases; as @deva[महान् बाहुः यस्य स महाबाहुः] [@deva[नलः]]; @deva[पीतं अम्बरं यस्य स पीताम्बरः] [@deva[हरिः]]. A Bahuvrihi compound partakes of the nature of an adjective and assumes the gender of the substantive it qualifies.

**Note**—In English such compounds are by no means rare; cf. high-souled, good-natured, narrow-minded &c.

**N. B.** The difference between a Karm. and Bah. comp. is this:—In the former, one of the member alone is in apposition to the substantive it qualifies, while in the latter the whole compound is an adjective. In the former the sense is complete in the comp. itself; in the latter it is not so; e.g. @deva[घनश्यामः नलः]; here one of the members viz. @deva[श्यामः] is in apposition to @deva[नलः] and therefore the comp. is a Karm. @deva[गंभीरनादः] as a Karm. simply means '@deva[गंभीरश्यासौ नादः] 'a deep sound,' and the sense is complete; as a Bah. it is equivalent to '@deva[गंभीरः नादः यस्य] 'some one whose sound is deep'; here the sense is not complete unless it is known whose sound is meant.
