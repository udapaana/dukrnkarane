## § 91. Rules for Bases Ending in क्, ख्, ग्, घ्, ङ्, च्, छ्, ज्, झ्, ञ्, ह्, प्, फ्, ब्, भ्

### (a) Nominative Singular - स् Elision

As a general rule the @deva[स्] @[s] of the nom. singular is dropped. If there be a conjunct consonant at the end of a word the first consonant only is retained.

### (b) Final Letter Changes

The final letter is changed to:
- The first or third of its class when followed by nothing
- The third when followed by a soft consonant
- The first when followed by a hard consonant
- Remains unchanged before a vowel termination

### (c) त्-Prefixing in Neuter Nouns

@deva[त्] @[t] is prefixed to the @deva[इ] @[i] of the N. & Acc. plural in the case of neuter nouns ending in a consonant except a nasal or a semi-vowel; but not in the case of a noun derived from the frequentative base.

See § 92 for paradigms.
