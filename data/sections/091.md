(a) As a general rule the @[s] of the nom. singular is dropped. If there be a conjunct consonant at the end of a word the first consonant only is retained.

(b) The final letter is changed to the first or third of its class when followed by nothing, to the third when followed by a soft consonant and first when followed by a hard consonant and remains unchanged before a vowel termination.

(c) @[n] is prefixed to the @[i] of the Du. & Acc. plural in the case of neuter nouns ending in a consonant except a nasal or a semi-vowel, but not in the case of a noun derived from the frequentative base.
