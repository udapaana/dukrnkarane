## § 931. Aorist - Continuousness and Nearness

The Aorist ought to be used when the idea of the **continuousness** or **nearness** of an action is to be implied:

**Examples:**

- @deva[यावज्जीवत्यादात्] @[yāvajjīvatyādāt] (Sid. Kau.) gave food throughout his life

- @deva[तेनं यायूयुकाल्यो तत्यायूनैरायूयूयुर चोनायत्यु] @[tenaṃ yāyūyukālyo tatyāyūnairāyūyūyur conāyatyu] (Sid. Kau.) he consecrated the fire on the last Paurṇimā (i.e. full-moon day) and offered Soma, &c.
