When the sense of an indeclinable participle is suppressed in a sentence the object governed by that ptc. or the place at or on which the action takes place is put in the Ablative case: @[prāsādāt prekṣate] sees from a palace (@[prāsādam āruhya prekṣate] Sid. Kau.); similarly @[āsanāt prekṣate] = @[āsane upaviśya prekṣate]; @[svargād avaruhya jihīte] = @[svargaṃ gatvā jihīte], Sid. Kau.
