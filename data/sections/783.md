(a) When two or more subjects differing in number are connected by 'and' the verb must be plural; @[tataḥ kuntī ca yudhiṣṭhiraḥ ca bhīmaś ca saha bandhubhiḥ | daduḥ arghyaṃ tasya rājñaḥ] &c. Mah. Bha. Sometimes the verb agrees with the nearest subject in number, @[sā ca satyavatī devī gāndhārī ca yaśasvinī | rājadevīḥ parivṛtā gāndhārī cāpi niryayau ||] Mah. Bha. @[ahaś ca rātriś ca ubhe ca sandhye vyaktaṃ jānāti narasya karma ||]

(b) But when they are connected by 'or' and are all sing. the verb will be singular, and when the subjects differ in number the verb will agree with the one nearest to it; @[rāmaḥ vā govindo vā gacchatu] 'Let Rāma or Govinda go,' @[saḥ vā ime bālāḥ vā āmraṃ gṛhṇantu] 'let him or these boys take the mango fruit.'
