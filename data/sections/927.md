rule: §927

The Imperfect is optionally used for the perfect when the particles @[ha] and @[śvas] are used in a sentence. @deva[इति ह अकरोत्] or @deva[चकार]; @deva[श्वोऽकरोत्] or @deva[चकार].

(a) It may also be optionally used in asking questions referring to a very recent time; @deva[अगच्छत्] @[kim]? (Qu.) (Ans.) @deva[अगच्छत्]; or @deva[जगाम] @[kim]? @deva[जगाम]; but when the question refers to a very remote time the perfect alone ought to be used. @deva[कृष्णः कंसं जघान] @[kim]? @deva[जघान].
