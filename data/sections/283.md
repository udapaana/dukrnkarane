@[a] is added to the finals of the following—

(a) @[yaśas] preceded by @[brahman] or @[hastin]; @[brahmayaśasam] 'the divine Majesty of brāhmaṇa or the glory of a Brāhmaṇa'; 'pre-eminence or sanctity arising from sacred knowledge'; @[hastiyaśasam] 'the splendour or magnificence of an elephant'.

(b) @[tamas] preceded by @[ava], @[sam] and @[andha]; e.g. @[avarataṃ tamaḥ avatamasam] 'slight darkness', @[saṃtataṃ tamaḥ saṃtamasam] 'great or continuous darkness'; @[andhaṃ tamaḥ andhatamasam] 'pitchy darkness'.

(c) @[rahas] preceded by @[anu], @[ava] or @[tapta]; @[rahaḥ avatamasam] 'secret, solitary'; @[avarataṃ rahaḥ avarahasam] 'a little secret', or 'desolate'; @[taptaṃ rahaḥ taptarahasam] 'a hot secluded place'.

(d) @[uras] in the Loc. and preceded by @[prati]; @[urasi pratigatam pratyurasam] 'against the breast'.

(e) @[vṛṣan] preceded by @[anu], when length is implied; @[anuvṛṣaṃ yānam] 'a vehicle measuring as much as a bull in length'.
