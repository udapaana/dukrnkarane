## § 494. The Parasmaipada singular terminations are strong; the rest weak. Before the strong terminations

§ 494.  The Parasmaipada  singular terminations  are strong; the rest weak.   Before the strong terminations the penultimate short vowel takes its Guṇa  substitute.  The  final  vowel  and penultimate  @deva[अ]  take  Vṛddhi  necessarily  in  the  third  and optionally in the first person singular.  In  the  2nd  person singular the final  vowel  takes  Guṇa  and  the  penultimate  @deva[अ] remains unchanged.
