rule: §494

The @[parasmaipada] singular terminations are strong; the rest weak. Before the strong terminations the penultimate short vowel takes its @[guṇa] substitute. The final vowel and penultimate @deva[अ] take @[vṛddhi] necessarily in the third and optionally in the first person singular. In the 2nd person singular the final vowel takes @[guṇa] and the penultimate @deva[अ] remains unchanged.
