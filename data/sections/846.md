rule: §846

† The Genitive, as already remarked, is not a Kāraka case. It, therefore, expresses simply the relation of one noun to another in a sentence, such as that of a servant and his master (a relation which is other than that expressed by a Kāraka case); @[rājñaḥ puruṣaḥ], @[etasya mātā], @[dravyasya khaṇḍaḥ] &c.; and even in those cases where the genitive is used in the sense of other cases it expresses simple relation or @[sambandha] only, as in @[satāṃ gatiḥ]; @[grāmasya jānīte]; @[mātuḥ smarati]; @[eṣaḥ udakasya upakurute]; @[bhaje hā yogeśvarān]; @[phalānāṃ vṛkṣaḥ], &c.
