## § 846. * The words @deva[अन्तिकुनुयुच] and others having the same sense, are

§ 846  * The  words  @deva[अन्तिकुनुयुच]  and  others  having  the same sense,  are
used in the Ablative, the Accusative and the Instrumental cases;
@deva[ग्रायुस्युयु  दूरुयुट्  कुटुङु  दूरेणं  वा]  away  from  the  village;  so  @deva[अन्तुकुयुयुट्  अन्तिकुयुङु
अन्तिकुनुयु  वा]  near  the village.

THE GENITIVE CASE.

§ 846  ‡ The Genitive,  as  already  remarked,  is not a  Kāraka
case.  It,  therefore,  expresses  simply  the  relation  of  one  noun
to  the  other  in  a sentence;  e.  g.  that  of  servant  and  his
master  (a  relation  which  is  other  than  that  expressed  by  a
Kāraka case);  @deva[रात्रुं  पुरुयुः  पुयुस्युरु  मातुरु  प्रयुस्युरु  सुणु]  &c;  and  even
in  those  cases  where  the  genitive  is  used  in  the  sense  of
other cases it expresses  simple  relation or  @deva[संवुन्युयुयु]  only,  as  in
@deva[युति  गवुस्  गोयोर्भुयु  युस्त्युतिकुरुर्तोरुयु  यथुस्युनं],  @deva[एयुयु  उदुदुयुयुयुस्यु  उयुदुयुनैरुयुतु]:  @deva[भेज्युं
मुयुनोभुरुयुयुवुयो];  @deva[फुटुयुनों दुयुयु], &c.
