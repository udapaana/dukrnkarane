@[samāhāra dvandva] is that species of @[dvandva] which implies an aggregate or the things enumerated in which constitute a complex idea. It is always singular and neuter.

Thus @[āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam] does not merely mean 'food, sleep and fear' but all that characterises animal life. In this species the meaning of the different members is subordinate to the collective sense of the whole compound.
