## § 816. † The Instrumental is also used to express the cause

§ 816.  † The Instrumental  is  also used  to  express  the cause
or motive or the object of purpose  of  an action as distinguished
from the mere  instrument  of  it;  @deva[पुण्युनेनं  दृष्टो  हरिः]  Hari  was  seen
by  (virtue  of)  merit;  @deva[तेनाऽपराधेनं  दुण्ड्युयोऽस्युति]  thou  art  to  be
punished for that fault; @deva[अवुयुवुनैनं  वसति]  dwells for the  purpose of
studying;  also  when  the  object  to  be  accomplished  is  simply
implied; @deva[अङुङु  अनेणु]  away  with  your  efforts  i  e  they  will  not
succeed; @deva[श्रुङुयुमु  सायुर्थं  नास्ति  इन्युयुयुः] (Sid  Kau  ).
