The Instrumental is also used to express the cause or motive or the object or purpose of an action as distinguished from the mere instrument of it; @[puṇyena dṛṣṭo hariḥ] Hari was seen by (virtue of) merit; @[tenāparādhena daṇḍyosi] thou art to be punished for that fault; @[adhyayanena vasati] dwells for the purpose of studying; also when the object to be accomplished is simply implied; @[alaṃ krameṇa] away with your efforts i.e. they will not succeed; @[krameṇa sādhyaṃ nāsti ity arthaḥ] (Sid. Kau.)
