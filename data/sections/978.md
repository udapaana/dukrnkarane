§ 6. In the case of metres regulated by syllables each line is divided by groups of three syllables called @deva[गण] @[gaṇa] or syllabic feet, named as @deva[म] @[ma], @deva[न] @[na], @deva[भ] @[bha], @deva[य] @[ya]; @deva[ज] @[ja], @deva[त] @[ta], @deva[र] @[ra], and @deva[स] @[sa]. The names and the Schemes of these are given in the following stanza:

@deva[मनुभजातारस्विध्यविदुरैः सजरतियुगालं विनियन्त्रिणाः पुरैर्विपुलतीर्णं ॥] @[manubhajātārasvidhyaviduraiḥ sajaratiyugālaṃ viniyantriṇāḥ purairvipulatīrṇaṃ]

i. e. @deva[म] @[ma] has all its syllables long; @deva[न] @[na] has all its syllables short; @deva[भ] @[bha] has its first syllable long, @deva[य] @[ya] has its first syllable short; @deva[ज] @[ja] has its middle syllable long; @deva[र] @[ra] has its middle syllable short; @deva[स] @[sa] has its last syllable long and @deva[त] @[ta] has its last syllable short.

The symbol ∪ stands for a short or light syllable; the symbol — denotes a long vowel or a heavy syllable. Symbolically represented these @deva[गण] @[gaṇa] will stand as under:

- @deva[म] @[ma]: — — —
- @deva[न] @[na]: ∪ ∪ ∪
- @deva[भ] @[bha]: — ∪ ∪
- @deva[य] @[ya]: ∪ — —
- @deva[ज] @[ja]: ∪ — ∪
- @deva[र] @[ra]: — ∪ —
- @deva[स] @[sa]: ∪ ∪ —
- @deva[त] @[ta]: — — ∪

Similarly the letter @deva[ल] @[la] is used to denote a short syllable and @deva[ग] @[ga] a long one at the close of a line.
