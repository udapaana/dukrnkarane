## § 304. Doubling of Monosyllabic First Member

@deva[एकाचो द्वे प्रथमस्य] @[ekāco dve prathamasya]

When the first member has only one vowel, it is doubled in certain Avyayībhāva formations.

e.g. @deva[सद्दः] @[saddaḥ] becomes @deva[सद्दद्दः] @[saddaddaḥ] in reduplicated forms.

**Obs.** This refers to reduplication rules specific to monosyllabic first members.
