In the case of Potential passive participles the agent of the action is put in the Genitive or in the Instrumental case; @[sevyaḥ mama mayā vā asau hariḥ] Hari ought to be served by me; @[rākṣasendrasya sevyaṃ mayā hāryam idaṃ vanam] (Bhaṭṭi. VIII. 129.) this forest which the lord of the demons ought to preserve must be destroyed by me; @[gatvā te vasatir alakā] &c. (Meg.) Thou should go to Alaka.
