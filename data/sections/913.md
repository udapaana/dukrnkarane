rule: §913

The infinitive is used with verbs and verbal nouns meaning 'to wish or desire' provided the agent of it is the same as that of the verb; @[kaḥ ituṃ icchati hareḥ hanuṃ] (Mud. I.) who wishes to snatch away the jaws of the lion; @[ahaṃ tvayā sākaṃ cāpitaṃ kṣārāmbuṣeṇa īhate]; Bhartr. 17. 6. But @[aham imān kartuṃ icchāmi] I wish him to do this, is wrong.
