rule: §4

The consonants are divided into @[sparśa]s or mutes (those involving a complete closure or contact and not an approximate one of the organs of pronunciation), @[antasthā] (or intermediate, the semivowels,) and @[ūṣman] or sibilants.

These are represented by thirty-three syllabic signs arranged as below:—

(1) @deva[कवर्ग] or the @[ka] group—@deva[क्] k, @deva[ख्] kh, @deva[ग्] g, @deva[घ्] gh, @deva[ङ्] ṅ.

(2) @deva[चवर्ग] or the @[ca] group—@deva[च्] c, @deva[छ्] ch, @deva[ज्] j, @deva[झ्] jh, @deva[ञ्] ñ.

(a) mutes (3) @deva[टवर्ग] or the @[ṭa] group—@deva[ट्] ṭ, @deva[ठ्] ṭh, @deva[ड्] ḍ, @deva[ढ्] ḍh, @deva[ण्] ṇ.

(4) @deva[तवर्ग] or the @[ta] group—@deva[त्] t, @deva[थ्] th, @deva[द्] d, @deva[ध्] dh, @deva[न्] n.

(5) @deva[पवर्ग] or the @[pa] group—@deva[प्] p, @deva[फ्] ph, @deva[ब्] b, @deva[भ्] bh, @deva[म्] m.

* @deva[उच्चैरुदात्तः। नीचैरनुदात्तः। समाहारः स्वरितः।] Pāṇ. I. 2. 29, 31.

† @deva[यञ्ञनासिकावचनोऽनुनासिकः] Pāṇ. I. 1. 8.

‡ Or six kinds only; so @deva[अ] means @deva[अ] and nothing else.

@deva[उच्चारणार्थं स्वरा मात्राश्च।] Pāṇ. I. 2. 27. The crowing of the cock in the morning represents in its three stages these three kinds of vowels. The time required to pronounce a short vowel is called a @[mātrā]. A long vowel has two @[mātrā]s and a @[pluta] vowel three.

that which proceeds from the upper part of the vocal organs, @[anudātta] that which proceeds from their lower part, while @[svarita] arises out of a mixture of these two.* But these are ignored in classical Sanskrit. They are marked only in Vedic works: the @[udātta] is left unmarked; the @[anudātta] is marked with a horizontal line underneath; and @[svarita] has a perpendicular stroke above it. e.g. @deva[क्व नु वोऽश्वाः] &c. Ṛg. X. 61. 2 @deva[वयशः] &c. Ṛg. I. 78. 4. @deva[शतचक्रं योऽश्विनः] &c. Ṛg. X. 161. 4.

Thus there are eighteen different modifications of each of the vowels @deva[अ], @deva[इ], @deva[उ], @deva[ऋ], and twelve of @deva[ए], @deva[ऐ], @deva[ओ] and @deva[औ]; for there is no long @deva[लृ] and the last four have not their corresponding short vowels.
