rule: §823
---

The roots @[kruṣ], @[druh], @[īrṣy], and @[asūy], and others having the same sense govern the Dative of the person against whom the feeling of anger, hatred, &c., is directed; @[haraye krudhyati druhyati īrṣyati asūyati vā] (Sid. Kau.) 'he is angry with Hari, or bears hatred towards him, or is jealous of him or finds fault with him;' @[sītā na krudhyat nāpy asūyata] (Bhaṭṭ. VIII. 75.) 'he did neither get angry with Sītā nor find fault with her.' but @[jāyāyai īrṣyati] 'he keeps a jealous watch over his wife' (that others may not see her @[mā enām anyo'drākṣīd iti] Sid. Kau.).

(a) But @[krudh] and @[druh] preceded by a preposition govern the Accusative case; @[kiṃ māṃ saṃkrudhyasi] 'why do you get angry with me?' @[nityam asmac charīram abhidrogdhum yatate] (Mudr. I.) 'he always endeavours to do harm to my body.'

Obs.—@[druh] with @[abhi] is also found used with the Dat. @[mā enaṃ viprāṇām evābhidudhugdhān anyena] (Uttar. VII.).
