Verbs are formed from nominal bases by means of certain affixes. These are not very much in common use and are generally used in the Present Tense. They have various meanings. They sometimes convey the notion of performing, practising, or using, or treating like the thing or quality expressed by the noun and are used transitively; sometimes they express the idea of acting, behaving or becoming like the person or thing expressed by the noun; and at others they yield the sense of desiring or wishing for the thing expressed by the noun. These will be arranged here under four heads, according to the affixes by which they are derived.

(a) By means of the affix @[ya] (@deva[क्यच्]) and Conjugated in Parasmai.
