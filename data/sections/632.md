## § 632. Conjugation of Ātmanepada Frequentative

In the Conjugational Tenses the Atm. Freq. Base is conjugated like the Conjugational base of the 4th class in Atm. In the General Tenses, and in all the Tenses of the Passive, the base loses its final @deva[अ] @[a] when the final @deva[य्] @[y] is preceded by a vowel and drops the @deva[य्] @[y] itself, when it is preceded by a consonant. As regards the Perfect, the Freq. Base takes the Periphrastic Perfect. In the Aorist the Atm. terminations of the 5th form are added. In the remaining Tenses the Atm. terminations with the intermediate @deva[इ] @[i] prefixed to them are added as usual. The passive is also formed like the Passive of derived verbs.
