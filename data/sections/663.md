## § 663. Verbs may be formed optionally from the words,

§ 663.  Verbs may be formed optionally from the words,
@deva[स्फायति], @deva[चयायति], @deva[भूरि], and @deva[अथ] by means of regular affixes, or
without the help of any affixes as given in the last para.
The special affixes are @deva[क्वच्], @deva[चङ्कृच्] or @deva[णिङ्]; so these four words
may be used in three ways:— 1. as nominal verbs with the
affixes added, 2. as verbs used transitively without affixes,
and 3. as nominal verbal bases not requiring any affixes for
their use. Thus @deva[स्फायि भाद्रये], @deva[स्फायति], @deva[स्फाययति],' to use salt.' so
from @deva[आत्मन्] we have @deva[आत्मति], @deva[मितायति], @deva[आत्मायते] respectively.
In the same way from other three also stems may be formed
Similarly from @deva[अम्भस्], @deva[पयस्], @deva[शुद्धे] we get @deva[णिङन्ति], @deva[पयस्यति],
&c. In all these cases the root affix may be taken to be @deva[गुर्]
or @deva[किर्].
