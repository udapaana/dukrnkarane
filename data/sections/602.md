The causal base of a root is formed like that of a root of the Tenth class. In the case of roots of the Tenth class the causal form is identical with the primitive. The causal form takes either @[pada]. Thus from @deva[बुध्] comes the causal base @[bodhay], @[bodhayati-te] 'he causes to know'; @[kṣubh-kṣobhayati] 'he shakes or agitates,' @[gaṇa-gaṇayati] 'he causes to count,' @[nī-nāyayati] 'he makes another lead or carry'; @[kṛ] 'to do' and @deva[कॄ] 'to scatter'—@[kārayati] 'he causes to do or scatter' @[kīrtayati], &c.
