## § 602. Formation of the Causal Base

The Causal Base of a root is formed like that of a root of the Tenth class. In the case of roots of the Tenth class the causal form is identical with the primitive. The Causal form takes either pada.

Thus from @deva[बुध्] @[budh] comes the causal base @deva[बोधय] @[bodhaya], @deva[बोधयति] @[bodhayati] 'he causes to know'; @deva[भ्रम्] @[bhram]—@deva[भ्रामयति] @[bhrāmayati] 'he shakes or agitates,' @deva[गण्] @[gaṇ]—@deva[गणयति] @[gaṇayati] 'he causes to count,' @deva[नी] @[nī]—@deva[नाययति] @[nāyayati] 'he makes another lead or to carry'; @deva[कृ] @[kṛ] 'to do' or 'to scatter'—@deva[कारयति] @[kārayati] 'he causes to do or scatter' @deva[कु] @[ku]—@deva[कावयति] @[kāvayati], &c.
