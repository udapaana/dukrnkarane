rule: §941

When disbelief in or intolerance of an action is intended to be expressed, and especially in the form of a question, the Simple Future is used optionally in the sense of the Potential; @[na saṃbhāvayāmi] or @[na marṣaye tvaṃ hariṃ nindet] or @[nindiṣyasi] I never believe, or cannot tolerate it, that you would or should speak ill of Hari; @[kaḥ] or @[kataraḥ katamaḥ vā hariṃ nindet] or @[nindiṣyati] who will speak ill of Hari (I do not believe that any body will, &c.); @[kaṃ śūdraṃ bhavān yājayej] or @[yājayiṣyati], &c.; when the word @[kiṅkaru] † (a particle, showing great anger) and roots having the sense of 'to be' precede, the Simple Future only should be used; @[na saṃbhāvayāmi] or @[marṣaye bhavān kiṅkaru śūdraṃ yājayiṣyati] I do not believe or like that you should make a @[śūdra] perform a sacrifice; so @[asti śaktiḥ vidyate vā bhavān śūdraṃ yājayiṣyati].
