## § 616. Formation of the Desiderative Base

The Desiderative base is formed by reduplicating the root or base according to the general rules of reduplication given at @ref[§ 444-449] and @ref[§ 549 (a) (b)], and by adding @deva[स] @[sa] (which may be changed to @deva[ष] @[ṣa] according to the rules of Sandhi) to it. The @deva[अ] @[a] of the reduplicative syllable is changed to @deva[इ] @[i]; e.g. @deva[पठ्-पठ्+स्=पिपठिष्] @[paṭh-paṭh+s=pipaṭhiṣ] by the following rule.

**N. B.** The @deva[स] @[sa] of a primitive root is not changed to @deva[ष] @[ṣa] when the characteristic @deva[स] @[sa] is changed to @deva[ष] @[ṣa]; @deva[सि-सिसीष्] @[si-sisīṣ], @deva[सिच्-सिसिक्ष्] @[sic-sisikṣ] (@deva[क+स] @[k+s]); @deva[सि-सिस्वपिष्] @[si-sisvap iṣ]; @deva[स्व-सुष्वप्] @[sva-suṣvap]; but @deva[स्था-तिष्ठास्] @[sthā-tiṣṭhās]; @deva[सा-सिसाष्] @[sā-sisāṣ] can. of @deva[स्-सुषावपिष्] @[s-suṣāvapiṣ]; @deva[स्वद्] @[svad], however, forms @deva[सुसूषति] @[susūṣati].

**Note:**—(1) A root takes a Desiderative form only when the agent of the wish and of the action expressed by the root is the same; so @deva[शिष्यः पठन्तु इति इच्छति गुरुः] @[śiṣyaḥ paṭhantu iti icchati guruḥ] and not @deva[पिपठिषति] @[pipaṭhiṣati]; also the sense of the root must be the object of the wish: @deva[भमनेन इच्छति] @[bhamanena icchati] cannot, therefore, be equal to @deva[निनमिषति] @[ninamiṣati].

**Note:**—(2) Though the Desiderative form of a root is not to be found often used in classical language in its character of a verb, yet nominal and participial derivatives from it are not uncommonly to be met with.
