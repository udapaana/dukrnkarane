rule: §616

The desiderative base is formed by reduplicating the root or base according to the general rules of reduplication given at § 444-449 and § 549 (a) (b), and by adding @[s] (which may be changed to @[ṣ] according to the rules of @[sandhi]) to it. The @[a] of the reduplicative syllable is changed to @[i]; e.g. @[paṭh] → @[pa-paṭh] → @[pipaṭh + s] = @[pipaṭhiṣ] by the following rule.

N. B. The @[s] of a primitive root is not changed to @[ṣ] when the characteristic @[s] is changed to @[ṣ]; @[si-sisīṣ], @[sic-sisiṣ] (@[s + i]); @[smi-sismayiṣ]; @[sṛ-sisīrṣ]; but @[sthā-tiṣṭhāsa]; the caus. of @[sā-śāśvayiṣ]; @[stu], however, forms @[tuṣṭūṣati].

Note:—(1) A root takes a desiderative form only when the agent of the wish and of the action expressed by the root is the same; so @[rāmaḥ devaḥ paṭhatu iti icchati śaruḥ] and not @[pipaṭhiṣati]; also the sense of the root must be the object of the wish: @[paṭhitum icchati] cannot, therefore, be equal to @[pipaṭhiṣati].

Note:—(2) Though the desiderative form of a root is not to be found often used in classical language in its character of a verb, yet nominal and participial derivatives from it are not uncommonly to be met with.
