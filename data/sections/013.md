As @[sandhi] is of primary importance in Sanskrit, @[virāma] or pause can be indicated only at the end of a sentence. The signs of punctuation, therefore, are only two, । and ॥. The former is used to mark the close of a sentence or the first half of a @[śloka] or poetical stanza; the latter is employed to denote the close of a @[śloka].

(a) The sign called @[avagraha] (and which represents half @[a] @[ardhākāra]) is generally employed to mark the elision of short @[a] after @[e] or @[o]; e.g. @[te'pi] (@[te + api]), @[kālo'sti] (@[kālaḥ + asti]). The double mark '' is sometimes used to indicate the elision of @[a] after initial long @[ā]; @[tayā + āste = tayā''ste].

(b) The mark ० is sometimes used to show that something is omitted, and which is to be understood from the context; e.g. @[a°] may stand for @[avagraha], @[ka°pā°] for @[kaviyaśaḥpārtha], &c.
