## § 13. Punctuation

As @deva[सन्धि] @[sandhi] is of primary importance in Sanskrit, @deva[विराम] @[virāma] or pause can be indicated only at the end of a sentence. The signs of punctuation, therefore, are only two, @deva[।] and @deva[॥]. The former is used to mark the close of a sentence or the first half of a @[śloka] or poetical stanza; the latter is employed to denote the close of a @[śloka].

### (a) @deva[अवग्रह] @[avagraha]

The sign called @deva[अवग्रह] @[avagraha] (and which represents half @deva[अ] @[a] @deva[अर्धाकार] @[ardhākāra]) is generally employed to mark the elision of short @deva[अ] @[a] after @deva[ए] @[e] or @deva[ओ] @[o]; e.g. @deva[तेऽपि] @[te'pi] (@deva[ते + अपि] @[te + api]), @deva[कालोऽस्मि] @[kālo'smi] (@deva[कालो + अस्मि] @[kālo + asmi]). The double mark @deva[ऽऽ] is sometimes used to indicate the elision of @deva[आ] @[ā] after initial long @deva[आ] @[ā]; @deva[तथा + आस्ते = तथाऽऽस्ते] @[tathā + āste = tathā''ste].

### (b) Omission Mark

The mark @deva[०] is sometimes used to show that something is omitted, and which is to be understood from the context; e.g. @deva[अ०] may stand for @deva[अर्जुन] @[arjuna], @deva[०प्रार्थी] for @deva[कविवर्यः प्रार्थी] @[kavivaryaḥ prārthī], &c.
