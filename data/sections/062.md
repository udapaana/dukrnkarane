## § 62. Declension of अ-stems (Masculine and Neuter)

Decline all nouns ending in @deva[अ] @[a] masculine and neuter similarly.

### (a) Locative Singular of अह्

The Loc. sing. of words ending in @deva[अह्] @[ah] (substituted for @deva[अहन्] @[ahan] a day, at the end of a Tatpurusha compound) is optionally formed like that of nouns ending in @deva[न्] @[n]; e.g. @deva[अह्] @[ah] has @deva[अह्नि] @[ahni], @deva[अनि] @[ani] or @deva[अहनि] @[ahani]. So @deva[अह्नि] @[ahni], @deva[अह्नि] @[ahni] or @deva[अहनि] @[ahani] etc. See p. 73.
