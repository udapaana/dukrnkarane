Decline all nouns ending in @[a] mas. and neu. similarly.

(a) The Loc. sing. of words ending in @[ahna] (substituted for @[ahan] = day, at the end of a Tat. comp.) is optionally formed like that of nouns ending in @[an]; e.g. @[tryaha] has @[tryahe], @[tryahṇe] or @[tryahni]. So @[vyāha], @[vyāhne] or @[vyāhni] &c. See p. 73.
