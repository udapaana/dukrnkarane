Every root in every one of the ten conjugational classes may take a passive form conjugated like an Ātmanepada root of the 4th Class.*

- The only difference is in the accent; in the passive it falls on @[ya], whereas in the case of the primitive verbs of the 4th class, Ātm, it falls on the radical syllable.
