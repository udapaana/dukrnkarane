## § 180. Formation of Compounds (@deva[समास] @[Samāsa])

In Sanskrit simple words, whether substantives, adjectives, verbs or indeclinables, have the power of entering into combination with one another and forming what are called '@deva[समास] @[Samāsas]', compound words or, in short, compounds.

### (a) Compounding of Compounds

A compound thus formed may further be compounded with another simple or compound word, and this again may become the member of a new compound.
