In Sanskrit simple words, whether substantives, adjectives, verbs or indeclinables, have the power of entering into combination with one another and forming what are called @[samāsa] (@deva[समासः]), compound words; in short, compounds.

(a) A compound thus formed may further be compounded with another simple or compound word, and this again may become the member of a new compound.
