When the several members of a @[dvandva] compound are viewed separately, it is called @[itaretara-dvandva], e.g. @[dhavakhadirau chindhi], 'cut down the Dhava and the Khadira trees.' In this species each member is of equal importance i.e. has its own independent meaning. It takes the dual or the plural according as the objects denoted by it are two or more in number; the gender of the final noun is the gender of the whole; as @[kukkuṭaś ca] a cock @[ca mayūrī ca] and a pea-hen @[ca kukkuṭamayūryau ime] (fem. dual of @[mayūrī]); but @[mayūrī ca kukkuṭaś ca mayūrīkukkuṭau imau]; @[rāmaś ca] Rāma @[ca nalaś ca] and Nala @[ca bharataś ca] and Bharata @[rāmanalakumarabharatāḥ] etc.

Exception—@[aśvaś ca] a horse @[vaḍabā ca] and a mare @[aśvavaḍavau] (mas. dual) a horse and a mare; @[ahaś ca] day @[rātriś ca] and night @[ahorātram] (neut. sing.) day and night.
