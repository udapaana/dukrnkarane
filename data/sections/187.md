## § 187. When the several members of a Dwandwa compound

§ 187.  When the several members of a Dwandwa compound
are viewed separately, it is called Itaretara Dwandwa, e. g.
@deva[धवखदिरौ छिन्नौ], 'cut down the Dhava and the Khadira trees '
In this species each member is of equal importance i. e. has its
own independent meaning.  It takes the dual or the plural
according as the objects denoted by it are two or more in num-
ber; the gender of the final noun is the gender of the whole;* as
@deva[कुक्कुटमर्घं] a cock @deva[मयूरी] a pea-hen @deva[च कुक्कुटमयूर्यौ इमे] ( fem. dual of
@deva[हरस] ); but @deva[मयूरी  च  कुक्कुटमश्च मयूरीकुक्कुटौ इमौ]; @deva[रामश्च लक्ष्मणश्च
भरतश्च शत्रुघ्नश्च रामलक्ष्मणभरतशत्रुघ्नाः]. &c.

Exceptions—@deva[अश्वश्च वडवा च अश्ववडवौ] ( mas. dual ) a horse and
a mare; @deva[अहश्च रात्रिश्च अहोरात्रः] ( mas. sing. day and night ).
