In four of the tenses and moods given above, viz, the Present, the Imperfect, the Imperative and the Potential, the verbs undergo peculiar modifications (@[vikaraṇa]) and these are therefore called Conjugational (@[sārvadhātuka])\* or special tenses and moods; and the remaining Non-Conjugational (@[ārdhadhātuka]) or general. In the former the characteristic marks and terminations of each are mostly added to a special base formed from the roots in various ways, while in the latter they are combined with the roots itself.

\* Strictly the term @[sārvadhātuka] (belonging to the form of the verbal base) is given by @[Pāṇini] to the terminations of all the tenses and moods; except those of the perfect and the benedictive, and to the affixes distinguished by an indicatory @[i] (@[śit]) i.e. the various conjugational signs of the 9 classes (except that of the eighth), and the terminations of the Present Participle Pars. and Atm. All other verbal affixes i.e. the conjugational signs of the 8th and 10th classes, the affixes added to form the causal base and a few denominatives, the affixes @[sya], @[iṣya], @[sa], and @[ya] added to the bases of the two futures, the desiderative and the Aor., and the passive and the frequentative respectively, and those forming the Past Participle (Act. and Pass.), the infinitive and the verbal indeclinables, and some others are called @[ārdhadhātuka].

(\*) The base (@[aṅga]) of a root is that form which it assumes before the personal terminations.
