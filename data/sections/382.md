## § 382. Conjugational and General Tenses - The Base (@deva[अङ्ग])

### Main Text

[The first part of this section is obscured in the OCR]

...gational ( @deva[आर्धधातुक] ) or general. In the former the characteristic marks and terminations of each are mostly added to a special base formed from the roots in various ways, while in the latter they are combined with the roots itself.

### Subsection

(a) The base ( @deva[अङ्ग] ) of a root is that form which it assumes before the personal terminations.

### Note

**OCR Quality:** The beginning of this section is corrupted in the source OCR. The visible portion discusses the distinction between conjugational (special) tenses that use modified bases (@deva[आर्धधातुक]) versus general tenses that attach terminations directly to roots. This follows from the discussion in § 380 about Vikarna-lakāras (Special Tenses) versus Sakārānta-lakāras (Common Tenses).

The term @deva[अङ्ग] (base) is defined as the form a verbal root takes before personal terminations are added.
