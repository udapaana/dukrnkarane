## § 2. Composition of the @deva[देवनागरी] @[devanāgarī] Alphabet

The @deva[देवनागरी] @[devanāgarī] alphabet consists of forty-two letters or @deva[वर्ण] @[varṇa], nine vowels or @deva[स्वर] @[svara], and thirty-three consonants or @deva[व्यञ्जन] @[vyañjana].[^1]

### (a) Sound Representation

These express nearly every gradation of sound, and every letter stands for a particular and invariable sound.

@note[type=note]: This explains why there are no names, as in Greek, for the different letters of the alphabet.

[^1]: Thus given by @[pāṇini]:

**Vowels:**

@deva:
अइउण् । ऋऌक् । एओङ् । ऐऔच् ।
:@

**Consonants:**

@deva:
हयवरट् । लण् । ञमङणनम् । झभञ् । घढधष् । जबगडदश् । खफछठथचटतव् । कपय् । शषसर् । हल् ।
:@

The alphabet, it will be seen, is divided into 14 sections by @[pāṇini], which are called @deva[शिवसूत्र] @[śivasūtra], or the sūtras revealed by @[śiva]. Each section ends with an indicatory letter called @deva[इत्] @[it] which is not to be counted among the letters of the alphabet.

These "@[it]s" serve an important purpose in Sanskrit grammar, as they enable the grammarians to express several letters, or groups of letters, in a very convenient and condensed form. For any letter, with the following @deva[इत्] @[it] added to it, is not only expressive of itself but of all letters that intervene between it and this @deva[इत्] @[it]; e.g. @deva[अण्] @[aṇ] means @deva[अ, इ, उ] @[a, i, u], @deva[इक्] @[ik] means @deva[इ, उ, ऋ, ऌ] @[i, u, ṛ, ḷ], &c.

Similarly @deva[अच्] @[ac] means technically the whole alphabet, @deva[अव्] @[av] any vowel, and @deva[हल्] @[hal] any consonant; @deva[यण्] @[yaṇ] a semivowel, @deva[हश्] @[haś] a soft consonant, @deva[खर्] @[khar] a hard consonant, @deva[जश्] @[jaś] a soft unaspirate, @deva[झष्] @[jhaṣ] a soft aspirate &c. Each of these significant terms is technically called a @deva[प्रत्याहार] @[pratyāhāra].

Since short vowels include the long and the protracted vowels (See § 3. a.) another @deva[इत्] @[it] @deva[त्] @[t] is generally employed to mark a particular vowel.
