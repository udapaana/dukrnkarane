## § 276. @deva[सहयुक्तेऽप्राणिनि] 

§ 276. @deva[सहयुक्तेऽप्राणिनि ।]

When used with @deva[सह], and when the first member denotes a lifeless object, the Accusative is dropped.

Example:— @deva[सधनम्] 'with wealth', @deva[सरथम्] 'with a chariot'; but not @deva[सहपुत्रम्], because @deva[पुत्र] is animate.
