§ 457.  In the  General  Tenses and  Moods  and in the formation of verbal derivatives generally,  the  augment  @deva[इ]  is prefixed ( necessarily or optionally )  to  terminations beginning with any consonant except @deva[य] in the case of certain roots. Such roots as take the augment @deva[इ]  necessarily are called Set ( @deva[स]+@deva[इट्] i. e.  with @deva[इ] ); such as take it  optionally are called Wet ( @deva[वा]+@deva[इट्] ), and those that do not,  are called  Anit ( @deva[अन्]+@deva[इट्] i. e.  without @deva[इ] ).
