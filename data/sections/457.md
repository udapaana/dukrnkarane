In the General Tenses and Moods and in the formation of verbal derivatives generally, the augment @[iṭ] is prefixed (necessarily or optionally) to terminations beginning with any consonant except @[y] in the case of certain roots. Such roots as take the augment @[iṭ] necessarily are called @[seṭ] (@[sa] + @[iṭ] i.e. with @[iṭ]); such as take it optionally are called @[veṭ] (@[vā] + @[iṭ]), and those that do not, are called @[aniṭ] (@[a] + @[iṭ] i.e. without @[iṭ]).
