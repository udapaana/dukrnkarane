A noun in the Ablative case is compounded—

(a) with words expressive of fear or rather with the words @[bhaya], @[bhīta], @[bhīti] and @[bhī]; as @[caurāt] @[bhayam] @[caurabhayam] fear from a thief; @[vṛkāt] @[bhītaḥ] @[vṛkabhītaḥ] afraid of a wolf, &c.

(b) in a few cases with the words @[apeta], @[apagata], @[apāsta], @[patita], and @[utsukta]; as @[sukhāt] @[apetaḥ] @[sukhāpetaḥ] deprived of happiness; @[kalpanāyāḥ] @[apagataḥ] @[kalpanāpagataḥ] 'transcending thought' or 'a poet'; @[svargāt] @[patitaḥ] @[svargapatitaḥ] 'fallen from heaven, as a sinner'; @[taraṅgāt] @[utsukta] 'afraid of waves'.

(c) in the case of the words @[stoka] a little, @[antika] near, @[ūrdhva] after, and words having the sense of these, and @[kaṣṭa] difficulty, there is an @[artha] of the Ablative, as @[stokāt] @[dūraḥ] @[stokadūraḥ]; @[alpāt] @[dūraḥ]; @[antikāt] @[āgataḥ]; @[abhyāśāt] @[āgataḥ]; @[dūrāt] @[āgataḥ]; @[vigrahāt] @[āgataḥ]; @[kaṣṭāt] @[āgataḥ].
