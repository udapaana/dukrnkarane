## § 626. Exceptions to Frequentative Formation

**(a)** A Frequentative may be formed from @deva[अट्] @[aṭ] 'to go,' @deva[इ] @[i] 'to go', @deva[अश्] @[aś] 'to eat' and @deva[गुह्] @[guh] 'to conceal,' though these begin with a vowel; and from @deva[वृत्] @[vṛt] cl. 10 'to hint,' @deva[वृज्] @[vṛj] cl. 10 'to string together', and @deva[वृष्] @[vṛṣ] cl. 10, though they belong to the 10th cl.

**(b)** The Frequentative of roots signifying motion conveys the notion of tortuous motion and not of repetition. The Frequentative of roots @deva[छुर्] @[chur] 'to cut,' @deva[सृ] @[sṛ] 'to sink down,' @deva[वृ] @[vṛ] 'to go' @deva[जप्] @[jap] 'to mutter prayers,' @deva[जृम्भ्] @[jṛmbh] 'to yawn,' @deva[दह्] @[dah] 'to burn,' @deva[दंश्] @[daṃś] 'to bite,' and @deva[गॄ] @[gṛ] 'to swallow,' imply reproach on the manner of doing the act. @deva[छोछुप्यते] @[chochupyate] 'he cuts awkwardly,' @deva[सासृप्यते] @[sāsṛpyate] 'falls down badly,' @deva[वावृत्यते] @[vāvṛtyate] &c.
