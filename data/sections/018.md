By @[sandhi] (from @[sam] together, and @[dhā] to join) is meant the coalescence of two letters coming in immediate contact with each other.

(a) @[saṃhitā] or @[sandhi] is necessary in the case of the internal structure of a @[pada], prepositions and roots joined together and a compound word (@[samāsa]), while in that of a sentence, i.e. in the case of the finals and initials of the different words in a sentence, it depends on the will of the writer.
