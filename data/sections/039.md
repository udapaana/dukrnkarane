If @[ṭ] or @[t] at the end of a word be followed by @[s], @[ṭ] (changed to @[ḍ]) is optionally inserted between them; * e.g. @[ṣaṭ] + @[santaḥ] = @[ṣaṭsantaḥ] or @[ṣaḍḍsantaḥ] = @[ṣaḍḍhasantaḥ] six good men; so @[sat] + @[puruṣaḥ] = @[satpuruṣaḥ] or @[saddhapuruṣaḥ] that good man.

(a) @[ñ], @[ṇ] and @[n] at the end of a word and preceded by a short vowel double themselves when followed by a vowel†; e.g. @[pratipaṇ] + @[ātmā] = @[pratipaṇṇātmā] the individual soul; so @[sugaṇṇīḥ] the best reckoner; @[sannacyutaḥ] good Achyuta.
