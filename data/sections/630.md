rule: §630
---

If a root ends in a nasal preceded by @[a] and the nasal is not dropped, @[ñ] (changeable to an Anusvāra or the nasal of the class to which the letter following it belongs) is inserted between the reduplicative @[a] and the first radical consonant; the @[a] of the reduplicative syllable remains unchanged (against § 629 b.)

@[yam]—@[yamy], @[yayamy] = @[yaṃyamyate] or @[yañyamyate], @[jan]—@[jany]—@[yajany] = @[jañjanyate] or @[yaṃjanyate], but when @[jan] = @[jāy], the A. Freq. base is @[jājāy], 3rd sing. @[jājāyate].

(a) The same rule applies to the roots @[car], @[phal], @[dah], @[jal], @[rah], @[daṃś], @[bhañj] and @[pac]. @[car] and @[phal] after inserting @[ñ] change the @[a] of the following syllable to @[u]; @[car] = @[cary]—@[cañcary] = @[cañcury] or @[caṃcu] = @[cañcūryate] or @[caṃcūryate] by § 594. @[phal] = @[phaly] = @[paphaly] = @[pañphuly] = @[pañphulyate] or @[paṃphulyate]. @[dah] = @[dahy]—@[dadahy] = @[daṃdahyate] or @[yañdahyate]. @[jal]—@[jalpy̅ate] or @[jaṃjalpyate].
