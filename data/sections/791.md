The relative agrees with its antecedent in gender, number and person, the cases of the relative and its antecedent being determined by their relation to their respective clauses; @[yasyāsti vittaṃ sa naraḥ kulīnaḥ] he who has wealth has a noble family, @[yasya buddhirbalaṃ tasya]; @[yena yujyate loke buddhastattena yojayet] what, which is fit to be united with anything, a wise man should unite with it &c.
