(b) Past participles showing the place of an action, as well as those used as abstract nouns are used with the Genitive; @[gadgadānusvāsitābhidam iva yātaṃ ramāpateḥ | duṣkṛtam etad asmākam ity ūcur gopyaḥ didṛkṣavaḥ | mayūrasya kekā], @[kokilasya vyāhṛtaṃ], @[naṭasya nṛtyaṃ], @[tasya hasitaṃ], &c.
