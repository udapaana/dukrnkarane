The most important of these conjunctions and the one very frequently used is @[ca]. It can never stand first in a sentence, nor can it be used like 'and' in English. It is used with each of the words or assertions it connects or is placed after the last of the words or assertions it joins together; @[rāmaḥ lakṣmaṇaśca] or @[rāmaḥ lakṣmaṇaśca]; @[kāmaśca sphuṭitaguṇo navayauvanaṃ ca] love with its excellences expanded, and fresh youth; @[prītikāntyā yaśasā kṣamayā guṇaiśca tairvibhātsi vinayapradhānaiḥ].

(a) Sometimes this particle has a disjunctive force, @[śāntamidamāśramapadaṃ sphurati ca bāhuḥ]—the hermitage is tranquil yet my arm throbs.

(b) Rarely this particle is used in the sense of 'if'; @[jīvitaṃ cecchasi bāliśa ehi me śaraṇam] O fool, if you wish to live, &c.

(c) Sometimes it is used as an expletive; @[vidvaḥ pārthastathaiva ca].

(d) Sometimes it is used to connect a subordinate fact with a main one @[bhikṣāṃ aṭa mṛgaṃ cānaya] wander for alms and bring a cow; @[kuṭṭinī ca śāsitā gopī ca niḥsāritā kandarpaketaśca dṛṣṭaḥ] the procuress was chastised, the cowherdess was expelled and Kandarpaketu was honoured.

(e) When the particle is repeated it has sometimes the sense of 'on the one hand,' 'on the other hand,' 'and also'; @[kva ca mṛgāṇāṃ ciraṃ sthirā jīvitavallī ca sukomalā ca kva cātilolāḥ kṣaṇaśīlitāścāpi ca niśitanipātā vajrakalpā hi śarāste] where, on the one hand, is the extremely frail life of fawns, and where, on the other, are thy arrows hard like adamant and falling sharply; @[na labhyā sakalendumukhī ca sā mahīyān cedamanaṅgaviśeṣkhilaḥ] on the one hand the full moon-faced lady is not easy to obtain and yet there is this unaccountable sport of love.

(f) Sometimes the repetition of @[ca] shows the simultaneous or undelayed occurrence of two events; @[eva ca prāpurudanvantaṃ buddhaśca ādipuruṣaḥ] they reached the ocean and at the same time the primeval Being also awoke.
