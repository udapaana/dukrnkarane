## § 966. The Conjunction @deva[च] @[ca]

The most important of these conjunctions and the one very frequently used is @deva[च] @[ca]. It can never stand first in a sentence, nor can it be used like "and" in English. It is placed after each of the words or assertions it connects, or is placed after the last of the words or assertions it joins together.

**Position Examples:**

- @deva[रामः लक्ष्मणः] @[rāmaḥ lakṣmaṇaḥ] Rāma and Lakshmana (or @deva[रामश्च लक्ष्मणश्च] @[rāmaśca lakṣmaṇaśca])
- @deva[कामेन सह गुणैः प्रफुल्लं च नवं यौवनं] @[kāmena saha guṇaiḥ praphullaṃ ca navaṃ yauvanaṃ] love with its excellences expanded, and fresh youth

**Special Uses:**

**(a) Disjunctive force:** Sometimes this particle has a disjunctive force.

@deva[ज्ञानतपोभ्यां स्थिरात्मा च बाहुः] @[jñānatapo­bhyāṃ sthirātmā ca bāhuḥ] the hermitage is tranquil yet my arm throbs

**(b) Conditional sense:** Rarely this particle is used in the sense of "if".

@deva[जीवितं चेच्छसि यत् हेतुं न गुरुः गण्यं] @[jīvitaṃ cecchasi yat hetuṃ na guruḥ gaṇyaṃ] oh fool, if you wish to live, etc.

**(c) Expletive:** Sometimes it is used as an expletive.

**(d) Connecting subordinate facts:** Sometimes it is used to connect a subordinate fact with a main one.

Example: Wander for alms and bring a corn; The procuress was chastised, the ox-wardess was expelled and Kardara­kam was honoured.

**(e) Repeated for contrast:** When the particle is repeated it has sometimes the sense of "on the one hand," "on the other hand," "and yet."

Examples showing contrasts where @deva[च] @[ca] is repeated to emphasize opposing ideas.

**(f) Simultaneous occurrence:** Sometimes the repetition of @deva[च] @[ca] shows the simultaneous or undivided occurrence of two events.

Example: They reached the ocean and at the same time the primeval Being arose.
