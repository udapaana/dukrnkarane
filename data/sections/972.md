The following stanza from the Bhaṭṭi Kāvya illustrates the uses of some of these interjections:—

@[āḥ kaṣṭe bata hīhā hūṃ mātaḥ dhig dhik vadanti ha |] @[hā pitaḥ iti atyadbhutaṃ iti tā ruruduḥ vilalāpuśaḥ ||]

- In Sanskrit there is no indirect construction, so that in translating indirect constructions the actual words of the speaker followed by @[iti] must be used.
