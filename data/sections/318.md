The words @[antavatī] and @[pativatī] form their feminine in @[ī] but have a @[nu] prefixed to the @[ī], @[antavatṇī] 'a woman big with a child', @[pativatṇī] 'a woman whose husband is living'. But if the word @[pati] means 'a lord or master of' @[ī] only is added, as @[patimatī] @[medinī] (the earth having a king).
