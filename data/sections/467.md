§ 467.  The roots @deva[सिञ्च्] 2 A. ' to shine ' and @deva[चैङ्] 2 A. ' to go ' do not take Guṇa or Vṛddhi before any termination. They also drop their final vowel before the intermediate @deva[इ] and @deva[य], @deva[दरिद्र] also drops its @deva[आ] before a  non-conjugational termination  except in the Desiderative and the Aorist where it retains it  optionally.

             THE TWO FUTURES AND CONDITIONAL.

                    ( 1 ) First Future ( @deva[लृट्] )
