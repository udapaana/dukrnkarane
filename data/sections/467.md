The roots @[śī] 2 A. 'to shine' and @[vī] 2 A. 'to go' do not take @[guṇa] or @[vṛddhi] before any termination. They also drop their final vowel before the intermediate @[i] and @[y]. @[vī] also drops its @[ī] before a non-conjugational termination except in the desiderative and the aorist where it retains it optionally.
