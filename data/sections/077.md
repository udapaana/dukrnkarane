Root nouns in @[i] or @[ū] M. F.

Rule of @[sandhi]—(a) The ending @[i] or @[u], short or long, of nouns derived from roots with the affix @[kvin] (@deva[क्विन्]) and of @[dhī], is changed to @[iy] or @[uv] before the vowel terminations*; the fem. nouns of this description are optionally declined like @[nadī] in the Du. Ab. Gen. and Loc. singulars and the Gen. plu.

(b) But if the ending @[i] or @[u] of a many-voweled noun having a root at the end be not preceded by a radical conjunct consonant or the root noun has a preposition termed @[gati] (i.e. @[upasarga] added to the root) or a word governed by the root preceding it, it is changed to @[ī] or @[ū], except in the case of @[sudhī] and roots ending in @[jū].

@[dhī] fem. @[bhū].

N. @[dhīḥ] @[dhiyau] @[dhiyaḥ] N. @[bhūḥ] @[bhuvau] @[bhuvaḥ]
