## § 1. Sanskrit Alphabet and @deva[देवनागरी] @[devanāgarī]

Sanskrit, or the refined language, is the language of @deva[देव] @[deva] or gods,[^1] and the alphabet in which it is written is called @deva[देवनागरी] @[devanāgarī], or that employed in the cities of gods.

### (a) Etymology of @deva[देवनागरी] @[devanāgarī]

The correct name for the Sanskrit alphabet is @[daiva-nāgarī] sometimes abbreviated into @[nāgarī]. Perhaps in the word @[devanāgarī] we have a history of the times when the Aryans entered and settled in Northern India. The Aryans who were much fairer in colour than the aborigines of India are the @deva[देव] @[deva] referred to in the name @[devanāgarī] (from @deva[दिव्] @[div] to shine, those of a brilliant complexion); and @[nāgarī] means the Aryan settlements within the precincts of which the sacred language was spoken.

### (b) Writing Systems

The Sanskrit language is generally written in different parts of the country, in that alphabet which is used for the vernacular (e.g. Bengali, Marathi &c.). That character, however, in which the earliest monuments are written (such as the inscriptions containing the edicts of @[aśoka]) and which is employed throughout Upper India is generally considered to be the real @deva[देवनागरी] @[devanāgarī].
