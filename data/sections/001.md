Sanskrit, or the refined language, is the language of @[deva]s or gods* and the alphabet in which it is written is called @[devanāgarī], or that employed in the cities of gods.

(a) The correct name for the @[saṃskṛt] alphabet is @[daiva-nāgarī] sometimes abbreviated into @[nāgarī]. Perhaps in the word @[devanāgarī] we have a history of the times when the Aryans entered and settled in Northern India. The Aryans who were much fairer in colour than the aborigines of India are the @[deva]s referred to in the name @[devanāgarī] (from @[div] to shine, those of a brilliant complexion); and @[nāgarī] means the Aryan settlements within the precincts of which the sacred language was spoken.

The Sanskrit language is generally written in different parts of the country, in that alphabet which is used for the vernacular (e.g., Bengali, Marathi &c.). That character, however, in which the earliest monuments are written (such as the inscriptions containing the edicts of Asoka) and which is employed throughout Upper India is generally considered to be the real @[devanāgarī].
