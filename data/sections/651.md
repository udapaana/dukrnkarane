The penultimate @[a] of a noun ending in a nasal is lengthened. The base is treated like a root of the Ist conjugation, its last vowel only taking @[guṇa] before this @[a]; @[kṛṣṇa] (name of Viṣṇu) @[iva ācarati]--@[kṛṣṇāyati] 'he acts like Viṣṇu,' @[kṛṣṇa]--@[kṛṣṇāyati] 'he acts like @[kṛṣṇa]' (@[kṛṣṇāmi] 1st sing.), @[kavi]--@[kavāyati] 'I act the poet or behave like a poet,' @[vihaga]--@[vihagāyati] 'he behaves like a bird,' @[sraj]--@[srajāyati] 'he or it acts like a garland' (Perf. @[sasrājāya] &c.), @[pitṛ]--@[pitarāyati] 'he acts like a father,' @[kṣiti]--@[kṣityāyati] 'acts like the earth' (Perf. @[cikṣityāya], &c. as @[kṣiti] is the base), @[rājan]--@[rājānāyati] 'he acts like a king,' @[pathin]--@[pathīnāyati] 'it serves as a road' &c. so @[idamāyati] from @[idam], @[śacrāyati] from @[śacī] name of Indra.

(a) The words @[atimalma] (a bold man), @[hoḍa] (a child) and @[virudh] take the affixes @[āya] and @[īya] optionally and are conjugated in the Ātmane @[atimalmāyate] or @[atimalmīyate], @[hoḍāyate] or @[hoḍīyate], @[virudhāyate] or @[virudhīyate].

(b) By means of the affix @[īya] (@[kyaṣ]) and conjugated in the Ātm.
