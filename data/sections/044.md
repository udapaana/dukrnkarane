@[ch] is necessarily inserted between @[ch] and the preceding vowel, short or long; and optionally when a long vowel at the end of a word, except that of the particle @[mā] and the preposition @[ā], precedes it; e.g. @[śiva] + @[chāyā] = @[śivacchāyā] Śiva's shadow, so @[tvacchāyā]; @[vetyacchidyate] what is cut again and again; @[lakṣmī] + @[chāyā] = @[lakṣmīcchāyā] or @[lakṣmīchāyā], @[mā] + @[chidat] = @[mācchidat] may he not cut; @[ā] + @[chādayati] = @[ācchādayati] he covers.
