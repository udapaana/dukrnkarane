Roots ending in long vowels (@[ū] and @[jū] included) form their Perf. P. irregularly; @[vas] is added to the root, which then undergoes the changes mentioned in § 394, and is finally reduplicated: when a root is Atm. it is first reduplicated and @[āna] afterwards added, the final @[a] changing to @[ā] before; e.g. @[kṛ] + @[vas] = @[kṛvas], by reduplication @[cikṛvas]; @[kṛ]—by reduplication @[cakṛ] + @[āna] = @[cakrāṇa]; similarly @[gā]—@[jagāvas], @[jagāṇa]; @[bhū]—@[bibhūvas], @[bibhūṣāṇa]; @[dā]—@[dadāvas], @[dadāṇa], &c.
