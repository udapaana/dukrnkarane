## § 407. Behavior of Final न in 5th and 8th Classes

The final @deva[न] @[na] of the base is optionally dropped before @deva[म्] @[m] and @deva[व] @[va] if it is not preceded by a conjunct consonant. It is changed to @deva[ण्] @[ṇ] before a weak termination beginning with a vowel, if preceded by a conjunct consonant and to @deva[ञ्] @[ñ] in other cases. The @deva[हि] @[hi] of the Imperative 2nd per. sing. is dropped after @deva[न] @[na] not preceded by a conjunct consonant.
