rule: §766

The gerund in @[am] of the root @[kṛ] is used:

(a) with the noun governed by it, if it be compounded with it prepositionally when censure is implied, @[caurakāram ākrośati] (@[cauraśabdam ucāratyarthaḥ]) 'cries out (he is) a thief, a thief.' In this case @[aṇ] is added to the noun governed.

(b) with the words @[svādu], @[lavaṇa], and @[saṃpanna], @[aṇ] being added to these as before; @[asvādum svādum annam śakte svādu-lavaṇa-saṃpanna-kāram bhukte] 'he eats having sweetened or seasoned his food.'

(c) with the words @[anyathā], @[evam], @[ittham], and @[katham], provided the root @[kṛ] loses its sense; @[anyathākāram vadati] 'he speaks in a different manner;' @[evamkāram bhukte] 'he eats thus;' similarly @[itthamkāram], @[kathamkāram], but @[śiro'nyathā vadati bhukte].

(d) with the particles @[yathā] and @[tathā] when an angry reply is given; @[yathākāram mokṣye tathākāram bhokṣye kim tavānena] (Sid. Kau.); 'I will eat in this manner, I will eat in that manner, what have you to do with that?'
