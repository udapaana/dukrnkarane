rule: §929

The Perfect denotes an action done before the current day and not witnessed by the speaker. It has reference to a very remote time and should, therefore, be used in narrating events of the remote past; @[atra] @deva[अपश्यत्] @[tāṭakāṃ] @deva[निजघान] @[rāmaḥ] । Rāma killed her whose name was Tāṭakā. @[prayayau] @deva[इन्द्रजित्स्य] @[ca] (Bhaṭṭi. XIV. 16.).

(a) In the 1st person the Perfect shows that the speaker was in a distracted state of mind or was unconscious when the event took place, or that he wants utterly to deny something that he has done; @deva[बहु] @[aha] @deva[परस्तात्स्य मत्ताः] @[ila] @deva[इत्याहुः] (Śā. XI. 39) being frenzied I prattled much, I am told, before him; @deva[कलिङ्गेष्ववात्सीः] @[kim]? didst thou dwell in the country of the Kaliṅgas? @deva[नाहं कलिङ्गेषु वसामास] । I never went to Kaliṅgas. With these exceptions the Perfect should not be used in the 1st person.
