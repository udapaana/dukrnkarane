## § 929. The Perfect Tense

The Perfect denotes an action done before the current day and not witnessed by the speaker. It has reference to a very remote time and should, therefore, be used in narrating events of the remote past:

**Examples:**

- @deva[तेनों तायूटकायूस्युयुनों निजयूयूनु रामः] @[tenoṃ tāyūṭakāyūsyuyunoṃ nijayūyūnu rāmaḥ] Rāma killed her whose name was Tāṭakā

- @deva[युयुयूयूविन्युदट्युच्युयुयुदुच्] @[yuyuyūyūvinyudaṭyucyuyuyuduc] (Bhaṭṭi. XIV. 16)

**(a) First Person Usage:** In the 1st person the Perfect shows that the speaker was in a distracted state of mind or was unconscious when the event took place, or that he wants to say the story of something he has done:

**Examples:**

- @deva[बहु जुयूयुयुट् पुरुत्तुयुयुस्युयु यूयूयूक्तुछुयुहुयुयु] @[bahu juyūyuyuṭ puruttuyuyusyuyu yūyūyūktuchuyuhuyuyu] (Śiś. XI. 30) being frenzied I prattled much, I am told, before him

- @deva[छुलिङुयूनुयूरुयूस्तोः किंयु] @[chuliṅuyūnuyūruyūstoḥ kiṃyu] didst thou dwell in the country of the Kalingas?

- @deva[यहुयूदु कुलिङुगुयुनुयूयूगायु] @[yahuyūdu kuliṅuguyunuyūyūgāyu] I never went to Kalinga

With these exceptions the Perfect should not be used in the 1st person.
