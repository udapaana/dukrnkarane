## § 350. Conclusion of Taddhita Affix Section

The Taddhita affixes play a crucial role in Sanskrit word formation, allowing the creation of derivatives from existing nominal bases. The rules governing their application involve complex interactions of phonetic changes, semantic shifts, and contextual variations.

Students should practice recognizing these affixes in texts and understanding their semantic contributions to word meaning. The systematic study of Taddhita affixes enhances both vocabulary acquisition and comprehension of Sanskrit grammatical structure.

**N. B.** Further study of Kṛt (primary) affixes will be undertaken in subsequent chapters, completing the overview of Sanskrit derivational morphology.
