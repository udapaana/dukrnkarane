The Indeclinable Past Participles are of the nature of gerunds. They fall under two heads:—(1) Those derived by affixing @deva[त्वा] to the simple root; and (2) Those derived by means of @deva[य] affixed to the root compounded with prepositions or words used prepositionally, @[gam]—@[gatvā] 'having gone,' @[bhū] with @[anu]—@[anubhūya] 'having experienced,' &c.
