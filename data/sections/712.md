The affixes @[tavya] or @[anīya] are added to roots or derivative bases in the sense of 'must be, fit to be,' &c. Before these the ending vowel and the penultimate short @[a] of a root take their Guṇa substitute. Before @[tavya] Seṭ roots take @[i], Aniṭ roots do not, and Veṭ roots take it optionally. Before @[anīya] penultimate @[ṛ] is always changed to @[ar] and not to @[ra] (as @[i] sometimes does); e.g.

*@[tavyānīyayor-vidhi]. Pāṇ. III. 1. 96. @[ṇyata upasaṃkhyānam]. Vārtika.

@[dhāvya] what ought to be frequently washed.

@[jijñāpayiṣā] Desi. Base

of @[jñā]—@[boddhikṣaṇīya], desired to know.
