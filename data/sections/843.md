rule: §843
---

(a) The Ablative often denotes the cause of an action or condition and may be translated by 'on account of, by reason of,' &c.; @[maunāt] @[mūrkhaḥ] @[gaṇyate] one is considered a fool by reason of his silence (if he keeps silence); @[gomānuṣāṇāṃ] @[vadhāt] (R.) on account of my killing cows and men.

(b) The Ablative is used to make a causative assertion or to advance an argument; @[parvataḥ] @[vahnimān] @[dhūmāt] The mountain is fiery (has fire on it), because there is smoke; @[smṛtyanavakāśadoṣaprasaṅgaḥ] @[iti] @[cet] @[na] @[anyasmṛtyaṇavakāśadoṣaprasaṅgāt] (Ved. Su. II. 1, 1) A disputant says—if you say that our argument is liable to the fault of giving no scope to your smṛti, then we reply: this your argument will not hold; for in that case other smṛtis will have no scope given to them.

(c) The Ablative is used with comparatives or words having a comparative sense; @[bhaktimārgāt] @[jñānamārgaḥ] @[śreyān] the way of Knowledge is more efficient than that of devotion; @[aṇoḥ] @[api] @[kṣīyān] smaller than an atom; @[sahasrāśvamedhāt] @[satyam] @[eva] @[śreṣṭham] @[ucyate] truth alone is superior to a thousand horse-sacrifices; @[caitraradhāt] @[anūnaḥ] not inferior to Chaitraratha.
