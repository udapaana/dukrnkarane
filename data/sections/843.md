## § 843. (a) The Ablative often denotes the cause of an action

§ 843. (a) The Ablative often denotes the cause of an action
or condition and may be translated by 'on account of, by reason
of,' &c; @deva[भौनुयुन्युयुयुदीः  गणुयुते]  one  is  considered a fool  by  reason  of
his  silence  (if  he  keeps  silence);  @deva[गोमानुप्युयुयुणों  क्तुयुयुट्]  (H.)  on
account of my killing cows and men.

(b) The Ablative is used to make a causative assertion or to
advance  an  argument;  @deva[यवुतो  भूद्युयुयुयु  यमुयुयुट् ।]  The  mountain is
fiery (has fire on it);  because  there  is  smoke  @deva[सत्युयुरुणुयुरु]-
@deva[युयुकुदु  हेति  चुन्युयुत्युयुयुयुच्युयुयुनुवुकुयुयुयुदोनुयुयुनोयुयुयुट्]  (Ved,  Su  II  I.  1.)  the
disputant says—if you say  that  our  argument  is  liable  to  the
fault of giving no scope to your smṛitis then we reply: this your
argument  will  not  hold;  for  in  that  case  other  smṛitis  will
have  no  scope  given  to  them.

(c) The Ablative is used with comparatives or words having
a  comparative  sense;  @deva[भुक्तुयुयुङुर्युंट्  ज्ञानुयुगुर्णों  श्रुयुयुयुट्]  the  way  of
knowledge is more efficient than that of devotion; @deva[अणुयुरुयुणुयुणोचुयुच्युरु]
smaller  than  an  atom;  @deva[अयुयुनैनुयुसुहुदुभुयुस्युः  सत्युयुयुवुनोतुरिच्युयुनं]  truth
alone is superior to a  thousand  horse-sacrifices;  @deva[वैयुवुरुयुयुयुरुयुयुङुनो] not
inferior to Chaitraratha.
