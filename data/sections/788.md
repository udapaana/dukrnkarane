rule: §788
---

An adjective, participial or qualitative, must agree with the substantive it qualifies in gender, number and case; @[rūpavān puruṣaḥ] a handsome man; @[sundarī strī] a beautiful woman; @[mahat saṅkaṭam] a great calamity, @[ete rūpavantaḥ], @[tāni sundarāṇi]; @[dhāvinī nārī], &c.

But numeral adjectives of fixed gender and number remain unchanged:—@[śataṃ brāhmaṇāḥ] a hundred Brahmanas, @[śataṃ striyaḥ] a hundred women, @[viṃśatiḥ bālakāni] twenty children.
