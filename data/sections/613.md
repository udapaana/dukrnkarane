Any primitive root of the ten classes, as well as any causal base, may optionally* take a desiderative form which, like the causal base, is conjugated in all the ten Tenses and Moods of three voices.

- Or the notion of desire may be conveyed by means of a sentence; @[e.g.] @[pipathiṣati] or @[paṭhitum icchati] 'he wishes to read,' &c.
