## § 962. Conditional in Place of Potential (Observation)

When a past action is to be indicated the Conditional may be optionally used in the sense of the Potential.

**Example:**

@deva[कथं नाम तवधर्माभ्यागत्] @[kathaṃ nāma tavad­harmābhyāgat] or @deva[त्यजेत्] @[tyajet] how could you give up your religion?

**(a)** Also where the Potential is used in conjunction with the particles @deva[इत] @[ita], @deva[आपि] @[āpi], @deva[जातु] @[jātu] etc.

**(b)** When wonder is to be expressed the Conditional is optionally used where the Potential is used in combination with the particles @deva[काच्] @[kāc], @deva[मान] @[māna] or @deva[यदि] @[yadi] when the action does not take place.
