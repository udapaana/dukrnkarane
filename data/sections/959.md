Sometimes the Potential is used without a subject when it is used in the sense of 'a precept or advice'; @deva[आपदर्थे धनं रक्षेद्धनैरपि] । @deva[आत्मानं सततं रक्षेद्धनैरापि] ॥ (a man) should save money for adversity; he should save his wife at the cost of his wealth and himself even at the expense of his wife and wealth. @deva[यद्रोचेत विप्रेभ्यस्तत्प्रयच्छेदमत्सरः] (one) should serve Brāhmaṇas with all that they like, without being jealous.
