## § 623. Non-Conjugational Tenses of the Desiderative

**(a)** The Perfect is formed by adding @deva[आम्] @[ām] to the base and appending the Perfect forms of the auxiliary verbs @deva[अस्] @[as], @deva[भू] @[bhū], and @deva[कृ] @[kṛ] (see @ref[§ 490], @ref[§ 526]).

**(b)** In the Aorist the Desiderative Bases take the terminations of the 5th Variety.

**(c)** In the Benedictive the Parasm. terminations are added without @deva[इ] @[i] and the Atm. ones with the intermediate @deva[इ] @[i].

**(d)** The remaining tenses have no peculiarities.
