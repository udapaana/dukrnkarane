## § 675. The participle of the Perf. Par, and Atm. is formed

§ 675.  The participle of the Perf. Par, and Atm. is formed
by adding @deva[वसु] and @deva[आन] generally to that form of the root which
it assumes before the termination of the 3rd per. plural. If this
form consists of one syllable only or when the root ends in @deva[आ],
@deva[वस्] has the intermediate @deva[इ] added to it. @deva[इ] is optionally prefixed
to @deva[वस्] in the case of the roots @deva[गम्] , @deva[इय्] , @deva[हुव्] , @deva[विश्] and @deva[विद्य्] ( 6 cl. );
@deva[चत्] and @deva[स्पर्] , and @deva[गुच्] and @deva[हृत्] when they do not take @deva[इ], form this
participle from that base which they would assume before the
2nd per. sing. termination.
