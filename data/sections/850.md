The root @[jñā] meaning 'to have an incorrect knowledge of' governs the Genitive; @[ajasya ghṛtaṃ jānīte] supposes oil to be ghee, but @[ajaṃ ghṛtaṃ jānīte].

(a) Verbs implying 'to think of, to remember,' such as @[smṛ], @[hṛ] with @[anu], 'to be master of,' such as @[īś], @[śak] with @[pra], &c. and to have compassion on such as @[dayā] &c., govern the genitive of their object, @[kuberadhātuḥ smarasi] (Megh. 90) dost thou remember the lord? @[amarāvatīvāsinām evānutiṣṭhate] Bhaṭṭ. VI. 60. 3 @[adhyeti tava lakṣmaṇaḥ] (Bhaṭṭi VIII. 119.) Lakṣmaṇa remembers thee, @[praśāsti nijasya kanyakājānasya mahārājaḥ] (Māl. Mād. 4.) the great king has mastery over his daughter; @[yadi taṃ dṛṣṭvā'haṃ ātmanaḥ praśakṣyāmi] (Uttar.) if after I see him I shall have control over myself; @[aṅgānāṃ anīśo'smi svāpāt] (Śāk. 71.) I have lost all power over my limbs; @[kathaṃcidīśā manasāṃ babhūva] (Kum. III. 34.) with great difficulty they could control their minds, @[śvastanikatvam vidyāyā yeṣāṃ vittaṃ teṣāṃ dayase na kasmāt] (Bhaṭṭi. I. 33.) why dost thou feel no compassion for those whose wealth does not see the morrow? @[sītāyā dayamānaḥ] (Ibid. VIII 119) taking pity on Sītā.

(b) @[kṛ] meaning 'to impart additional properties' governs the Genitive; @[eṣodakasya upakarute] 'fuel imparts heat to water.' @[kiṃ kasyacid upakarute] Bhaṭṭi. VIII. 119.
