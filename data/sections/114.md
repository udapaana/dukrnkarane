## § 114. ( a ) @deva[उषस्] ( dawn, light ) is one of the few bases

§ 114. ( a ) @deva[उषस्] ( dawn, light ) is one of the few bases
which have @deva[ष्] for its final ; this word is one of those substan-
tives which possess only the singular number ( @deva[वचनान्तर इत्यु]-
@deva[दयनः], Pan. I. 2. 25 Vart. ). There are other feminine bases end-
ing in @deva[ष्] which are derived from the roots @deva[दुह्] &c., viz. ( a )
@deva[दोघ्रि] dughati → @deva[दोघ्री] → @deva[दोगवष्] ( @deva[द्युष्], @deva[द्व०] III. 2. 70 ; Pan. III. 2. 61 ),
