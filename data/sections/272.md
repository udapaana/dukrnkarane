## § 272. @deva[गमनार्थेभ्यो विभक्तितो रुट्] 

§ 272. @deva[गमनार्थेभ्यो विभक्तितो रुट् । अनुपसर्गात् साद्यसम्पत्योर्लुक् ॥]

Obs. @deva[रुट्] is a technical name for the first member of a compound being in the Accusative. After roots meaning 'to go' with a preposition prefixed, the first member is in the Accusative. But when @deva[सा] (with) is prefixed, the compound has the sense of accomplishment, and the Accusative is dropped. Similarly, when @deva[अनु] is prefixed, the sense being 'conformity', the Accusative is dropped.

Examples:— @deva[अनुगङ्गम्] 'along the Ganges', @deva[प्रतिकूलम्] 'against the current', @deva[समुद्रम्] (not @deva[समुद्रम्]) 'along with the ocean' (@deva[सम्]+@deva[उदन्]), @deva[अनुरथम्] 'after or according to the chariot'.
