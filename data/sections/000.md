This work is Kale's "A Higher Sanskrit Grammar". As you will see, the work is very much a product of its time. But despite these flaws, it is still the finest English language reference grammar for Sanskrit by a native grammarian. We hope that it can serve as a start to a more robust, modern grammar for the Sanskrit language.

To this end, we hope to:

1. modernize the language in the text,
2. add support for @[vaidīka saṃskṛta], and
3. present the text in a more modern digitally augmented format.

From you, the reader, we hope that you can read and also edit to fix errors as you see them.

Several parts of the original book remain undigitized:

1. the extensive appendix,
2. some stray sections are completely mangled,
3. formatting is quite inconsistent, and
4. some sections are missing data entirely.
