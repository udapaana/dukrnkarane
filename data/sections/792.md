rule: §792

When the relative has for its predicate a noun differing in gender from the antecedent the relative generally takes the gender of the antecedent noun, the demonstrative pronoun following that of the noun it qualifies; @[varadamāsahiṣṇutvaṃ hi yat tad durjanānāṃ svabhāvaḥ]—non-endurance of the merits of another is but the nature of the wicked; @[śītalaṃ hi yat sā svarakṛtir jalasya].
