A Bah. ending in @[pād] (substituted for @[pāda]) optionally forms its fem. in @[ī] before which it is changed to @[pad]; @[mṛdavaḥ iva pādau yasyāḥ sā vyāghrapād-padī], @[haṃsapād-padī] and in @[ā] when @[pāda] means 'a foot of a Vedic verse'; @[tripadā gāyatrī], @[ekapadā] &c.

(a) But if @[pāda] be preceded by one of the words @[kumbha], @[muṣala], @[tṛṇa], @[hasta], @[kāka], @[sthūṇā], @[paṭa], &c. the fem. is necessarily formed in @[ī], @[pād] changing into @[pad] as before; @[kumbhapadī] 'a woman whose feet are as big as a pitcher'.
