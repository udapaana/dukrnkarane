(a) Roots of more than one syllable, derived roots and roots of the 10th class are always @[seṭ].

(b) Of all monosyllabic roots ending in a vowel those given in the following couplet (@[kārikā]) are @[seṭ] and the rest @[aniṭ].

"@[ūdṛdantairayostistrakhakhaśīṣṇiyadviḍīrūbhibhiḥ] । @[iddañjñābhyāṃ ca vinekacho'jānteṣu nihatāḥ seṭaḥ]" ॥

i.e. roots ending in long @[ū] and long @[ṛ]; the roots @[su], @[ṇu], @[kū], @[khyā], @[stu], @[ri], @[lī], @[khī], @[śī], @[ṣṇi], @[yi], @[dvi], @[ḍī], @[rū], @[bhī], @[bhṛ], @[id] cl. Ā. and @[añj] & @[jñā] cl. P. Ā. are @[seṭ] (excepting these, all monosyllabic roots ending in a vowel are @[aniṭ]).

(c) Of monosyllabic roots ending in a consonant the following 102 are @[aniṭ]; and the remaining @[seṭ].

"@[gañca pacātiricca bacca vicca] । @[sicca mucca tyajñca nijibhajāḥ] ॥ @[ṛcca khajñca bhrajjañca artiścitya rujñca] । @[rañjañca vijñca svajisajañjñakhajāḥ] ॥ @[adcha kṣudcha khidcha chidcha bhidañca nṛdaḥ] । @[chidcha bhidcha vṛtirbinaddha] ॥ @[nādañca sadīndanaḥ skandha] । @[śyadī kadhañca kṣubhiddhradhyatī] ॥ @[ardhiryudhirudhī śrāpi] । @[yutsyutaḥ sādhisiddhyatī] ॥ @[ardhyadañca nāpcha kṣipañca dapacha tapcha] । @[stabdhastupyatisṭaṇyatī] ॥ @[kṣipañca lipcha labcha śapcha svapcha sṛpiñca yamcha] । @[ramcha lamcha gamcha namcha yamo ramiḥ] ॥ @[karaśiraśidṛśī kudrā grāhañca eṭi rudrā lihā vidañca sthāḥ śliṣṭāḥ] ॥ @[tuṣñca duṣcha diṣcha duṣcha puṣyañca piṣañca miṣañca śiṣañca haṣañca dīpyatayo ghasīḥ] ॥ @[vasatirvahutidridṛho nahcha mṛhaṃ] @[ruhañca lihañca vahistathā] ॥ @[adātā halānteṣu ghāto vahantaḥ satañca evaṃ] ॥

(d) The following roots are @[veṭ]:—

@[śvaratiḥ sayate jñāte pañcame navame ca vā ghuṃ] । @[vanañciśratiśvāntāvanāktaiśca tanākñinā] ॥

The following couplet gives the endings of these roots and their number in each:—

@[kañca chajañca dadhanapaṃ mānarapaḥ kṣayātma karāt] । @[yalaśaḥ sahaḥ triṣaḍdaśaikāḥ smaratāḥ] ॥

The first line gives the ending consonants and thus enables the students to know at once which root is @[seṭ] and which is @[aniṭ]; e.g. @[bhṛ] may be at once known to be a @[seṭ] root as @[ṛ] does not occur in the first line. The second line gives the number of roots ending in a particular consonant. Thus roots ending in @[k] are 1 i.e. one (@[k] being the first consonant) in number, roots ending in @[c] are 6 i.e. six, (@[c] being the 6th consonant); roots ending in @[j] are 1 i.e. one, in number, and so on.
