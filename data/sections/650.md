Nominal bases are formed without the addition of any affix: the characteristic signs of the tenses and moods and the personal terminations being added immediately to the nominal base. The bases thus derived convey the notion of acting or behaving like that which is expressed by the noun, and are conjugated in the @[parasmaipada].
