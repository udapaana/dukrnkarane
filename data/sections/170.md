Other derivatives from the numerals:—

(a) by the @[taddhita] affix '@[ṭhañ]' which is added to numerals ending in @[śat] and @[ti] e. g. @deva[पञ्चकः] bought for five (rupees &c.) @deva[चत्वारिंशत्कः] bought for forty; @deva[विंशतिकः] bought for twenty (coins, &c.)

(b) by means of the Tad. affix @[taya] in the sense of "consisting of parts" or "collection"; e. g. @deva[चतुष्टय] (@deva[चतुष्टयी] fem.) consisting of four parts or a collection of four; so @deva[पञ्चतय] (fem. @deva[यी]);
@[taya] is optionally changed to @[ya] after @[dvi] and @[tri] e. g. @deva[द्वय] or @deva[द्वितय] (@deva[-यी] fem.) twofold, consisting of two parts, or a pair;
@deva[त्रय] or @deva[त्रितय] (@deva[-यी] fem.) threefold or consisting of three parts, a collection of three, a triad.

(c) by means of @[ka] and @[t] e. g. @deva[षट्क], a collection of six, @deva[पञ्चत्] collection of five, @deva[दशत्] a collection of ten, a decade, &c.
