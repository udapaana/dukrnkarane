## § 170. Other derivatives from the numerals:—

§ 170.  Other derivatives from the numerals:—

( a )  by the Taddhita affix @deva[क] which is added to numerals
ending in @deva[शत्] and @deva[ति] e. g. @deva[पञ्चकः] bought for five ( rupees &c. )
@deva[चत्वारिंशत्कः] bought for forty; @deva[वैशतिकः] bought for twenty
( coins, &c. )

( b ) *by means of the Tad. affix @deva[तय] in the sense of " consisting
of parts" or "collection"; e. g. @deva[चतुष्टयं] ( @deva[चतुष्टयी] fem. ) consist-
ing of four parts or a collection of four; so @deva[पञ्चत्य] ( fem. @deva[यी]);
@deva[तय] is optionally changed to @deva[अय] after @deva[द्वि] and @deva[त्रि]  e g. @deva[द्वय] or
@deva[द्वितय] (-@deva[यी] fem. ) twofold, consisting of two parts,  or a pair;
@deva[त्रय] or @deva[त्रितय] (-@deva[यी] fem. ) threefold  or consisting of three  parts, a
collection of three, a triad.

( c ) by means of @deva[क] and @deva[अच्] e. g. @deva[षट्] a collection of six, @deva[पञ्चन्]
collection of five, @deva[दशत्] a collection of ten, a decade, &c.
