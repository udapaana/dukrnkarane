With interrogatives the Present is often used in the sense of the Future when thought or desire is implied; @[kiṃ karomi] i.e. (@[kariṣyāmi]), @[kva gacchāmi] i.e. (@[gamiṣyāmi]) What shall I do? Whither shall I go? @[etayoḥ kataraṃ] or @[eteṣāṃ katamaṃ bhojayasi] (i.e. @[bhojayiṣyasi] or @[bhojayitāsi]) which of these persons will you feed? So @[kutra pṛcchāmi duḥkhārtā], &c.; but @[kaḥ tatra gamiṣyati].

(a) It is also used in the sense of the Future in conditional sentences as implying a condition and the fulfilment of the desired object; @[annaṃ dadāti] (@[dātā dāsyati vā]) @[sa svargaṃ yāti] (@[yātā yāsyati vā]) he, who offers (or will offer) food, goes (or will go) to heaven i.e. if one offers &c.
