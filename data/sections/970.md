## § 970. The Particle @deva[अयु] @[ayu]

The particle @deva[अयु] @[ayu] is used in the following senses:

**(1) As a sign of auspiciousness:**

@deva[अयुतो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा] @[ayuto brahmajijñāsā] now begins the inquiry about Brahma (cf. the Bhāṣya on this sūtra).

**Note:** Properly speaking this is not the sense of @deva[अयु] @[ayu]. The mere utterance or hearing of this word is considered as auspicious, as the word is supposed to have emanated from the throat of Brahmā.

**(2) Marks the beginning or commencement of a work:**

- @deva[आरभ्यत अयत ऋग्वेदस्य प्रथमः] @[ārabhyata ayata ṛgvedasya prathamaḥ] now is begun the first Tantra
- @deva[अय गीर्वाणभाषितं] @[aya gīrvāṇabhāṣitaṃ]

**(3) "Then", "after that":**

@deva[अय यत्र जागरस्येन्दोः] @[aya yatra jāgarasyendoḥ] (Meg. II. 1) After that (i.e., passing of the night) the lord of the earth, etc.

**(4) Asks a question:**

- @deva[अय कार्यं शक्यमस्माभिः कर्तुं] @[aya kāryaṃ śakyamasmābhiḥ kartuṃ] O venerable Kaśyapa, is it all right that he may oblige the world?
- @deva[अय खादितुं योग्यं] @[aya khādituṃ yogyaṃ] are you able to eat?

**(5) "And", "including":**

@deva[भीमः अय अर्जुनः] @[bhīmaḥ aya arjunaḥ] Bhīma and also Arjuna

**(6) "If":**

@deva[अय ध्रुवमृत्युः जन्तोः] @[aya dhruvamṛtyuḥ jantoḥ] if death is sure to befall a creature, etc.
