(Rag. II. 1.) After that (i. e. passing of the night) the lord of the earth, &c. (4) asks a question @[atha bhagavān kaśyapo lokānugrahāya kuśalī kārayiṣyaḥ] is the venerable Kaśyapa all right that he may oblige the world? @[atha tvam abhaktum īśas] are you able to eat?

† Properly speaking this is not the sense of @[atha]. The mere utterance or hearing of this word is considered as auspicious as the word is supposed to have emanated from the throat of Brahma.
