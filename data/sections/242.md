## § 242. *The word @deva[महद्] is changed to @deva[महा] when it forms the first member of a Karmadhāraya or a Bahuvrihi com

§ 242. *The word @deva[महद्] is changed to @deva[महा] when it forms the first member of a Karmadhāraya or a Bahuvrihi compound, or when the termination @deva[जातीय] follows; as @deva[महादेवः]. the great god, @deva[महाबाहुः] a great arm (Tat.) or one having a great arm (Bah.); @deva[महाजातीयः]; but @deva[महत]: @deva[सैवा महत्सैवा] (Gen. Tat.).

Exception:—When it is followed by @deva[यास], @deva[कर] and @deva[विभीष] the change takes place necessarily; @deva[महतो महत्या वा करः महाकरः]; similarly @deva[महाघासः], @deva[महाविभीषः].
