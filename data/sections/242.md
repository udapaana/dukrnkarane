rule: §242

The word @[mahat] is changed to @[mahā] when it forms the first member of a Karmadhāraya or a @[bahuvrīhi] compound, or when the termination @[jātīya] follows, as @[mahādevaḥ] the great god, @[mahābāhuḥ] a great arm (Tat.) or one having a great arm (Bah.); @[mahājātīyaḥ]; but @[mahataḥ sevā mahatsevā] (Gen. Tat.).

Exception:— When it is followed by @[chāga], @[kara] and @[viśiṣṭa] the change takes place necessarily; @[mahato mahato vā chāgasya karaḥ mahācchāgaḥ]; similarly @[mahākharaḥ], @[mahāviśiṣṭaḥ].
