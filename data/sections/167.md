§ 167.  @deva[ऊनत्रिंशति], @deva[विंशति] and other cardinal numbers up to
@deva[नवनवति] are all feminine substantives, the numerals @deva[शत], @deva[सहस्र],
&c. are all neuter, with the exception of @deva[लक्ष] which is neu. and
fem. @deva[कोटि] which is fem. and @deva[शंकु] and @deva[जलधि] both of which are
mas.  and have no declensional peculiarities. They are
declined in the sing.  and so  used with a plural noun; e. g.
@deva[पंचविंशोत्तिब्राह्मणाः] 25 Brāhmaṇas; @deva[एकादशा].@deva[पकशतेन] or @deva[एका]-
@deva[दशोत्तरेण शतेन नरैः] or @deva[स्त्रीभिः] by 111 men or women; @deva[एकोनसहस्रेण
रूपकैः] with Rs. 999 &c.  They may  be  made to have duals
and plurals by being used as fixed standards of counting; e. g.
@deva[ब्राह्मणानां विंशतयः] many twenties of Brāhmaṇas; @deva[द्वे शते नारीणाम्]
two hundreds of women &c.
