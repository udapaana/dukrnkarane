@[ekādaśan], @[viṃśati] and other cardinal numbers up to @[navannavati] are all feminine substantives, the numerals @[śata], @[sahasra], &c. are all neuter, with the exception of @[lakṣa] which is masc. and fem. @[koṭi] which is fem. and @[arbuda] and @[jaladhi] both of which are masc. and have no declensional peculiarities. They are declined in the sing. and so used with a plural noun; e.g. @deva[पञ्चविंशतिर्ब्राह्मणाः] 25 Brahmanas; @deva[एकादशाधिकशतेन] or @deva[एकादशोत्तरशतेन] @deva[नरैः] or @deva[नारीभिः] by 111 men or women; @deva[एकोनसहस्रेण] @deva[रूपकैः] with Rs. 999 &c. They may be made to have duals and plurals by being used as fixed standards of counting; e.g. @deva[ब्राह्मणानां विंशतयः] many twenties of Brahmanas; @deva[द्वे शते नारीणाम्] two hundreds of women &c.
