(a) A Dvigu ending in @[kāṇḍa] (a particular measure) and qualifying a word denoting 'a field' has its fem. formed by the addition of @[ā], but when a @[taddhita] affix has been first added to it and then dropped; as @[dve kāṇḍe pramāṇaṃ yasyāḥ asau dvikāṇḍa + mātrā = dvikāṇḍā avaṭiḥ] 'a piece of land 30 hands in extent'; but @[dvikaṇḍaṃ rajjuḥ] 'a rope, 30 hands in length'; also when the ending word is one that does not denote a measure, except the words @[niṣka] 'a tola', @[āhita] 'the load of a cart,' and @[kambalyā] (a weight equal to 35 tolas); @[pañcabhiḥ palaiḥ krītā asau pañcapalā], but @[viṃśatyā niṣkabhiḥ krītā asau viṃśaniṣkā sthālī]; so @[tripalā], @[dvikambalyā].

(b) ‡ When the word @[puruṣa] expressive of measurement ends a Dvigu and the @[taddhita] affix is added and dropped as before, its fem. is formed both in @[ā] and @[ī]; @[dvau puruṣau pramāṇaṃ asyāḥ dvipuruṣā-ṣī khātikā] 'a ditch two purushas (13 feet) in depth'.
