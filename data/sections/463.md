Neither @[guṇa] nor @[vṛddhi] is substituted for the vowel of a few roots of the 6th class even before a strong termination except the @[ār] of the 1st and 3rd person sing. of the perfect, the @[āya] of the causal and the @[i] of the 3rd pers. sing. of the passive aorist. These are @[kṛt], @[tṛp], @[dṛp], @[mṛṣ], @[kliś], @[liś], @[vid], @[chid], @[bhid], @[chind], @[bhṛś], @[vṛś], @[śak], and a few more not often to be met with.

- These couplets as well as those bearing on the 2nd variety of the aorist are composed by Mr. @[Chintāmaṇa] @[Ātmārām] Kelkar, the present learned @[Śāstri] at the Poona Training College.
