§ 790.  (a) Sometimes an adjective does not agree with its
noun in gender &c. but is put in the neuter  gender. This is an
idiom of the Sanskrit language: @deva[सर्वं देवदत्तः] all Devadatta is,
@deva[स नाम महद् गुणौघोपेतः] he was possessed of a great multitude of
virtues.

(b) When the adjective is put in the neuter  gender  it  may
be used either in the singular or in the  plural  according  to  the
noun it qualifies  @deva[सर्वाः स्त्रियः] all the women,  @deva[सर्वाणि  सत्त्वानि],  sev-
eral living  beings,  &c.
