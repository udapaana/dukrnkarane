The feminine of @[pati] is @[patnī] meaning 'the sharer with her husband in the fruit of the sacrifices performed by him'; but if it end a compound it may optionally remain unchanged except when preceded by @[a], @[vṛddhi], @[vīra], @[eka], @[su], @[dus], and @[yu] &c. before which this change is necessary; @[gṛhapati] or @[gṛhapatnī], the mistress of the house; or @[viṭapati] or @[viṭapatnī]; @[veśalapati] or @[veśalapatnī] &c. but @[sammānaḥ patiryasyāḥ sā sapatnī] a co-wife, @[ekapatnī], @[vīrapatnī].

N. B.—If there be no compound this change does not take place; as, @[grāmasya patiḥ] 'the mistress of a village', and not @[patnī], similarly @[gavāṃ patiḥ] &c.
