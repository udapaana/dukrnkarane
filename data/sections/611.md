## § 611. Conjugation of the Causal Base

The Causal base is conjugated like the base of a root of the 10th or Churādi class in all the ten Tenses and Moods of the Parasmaipada, the Atmanepada and the Passive. The @deva[अय्] @[ay] with the final @deva[य] @[ya] dropped is retained, as remarked before, in the General Tenses, except the Aorist and the Benedictive, and is dropped before the @deva[य] @[ya] of the Passive. The formation of the Aorist of causals has been fully explained along with that of the roots of the Tenth class, at @ref[§ 548-556].
