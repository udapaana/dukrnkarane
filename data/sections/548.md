Roots of the tenth Class and causals:—

(a) The @[aya] of the base is dropped (the vowel changes taking place before it being retained) and a short vowel substituted for the long one (@deva[ऐ] and @deva[औ] being shortened to @deva[इ], and @deva[ऐ] and @deva[औ] to @deva[उ]).

The base so modified is then reduplicated according to the general rules; @[bhāvaya] (Cau. B. of @[bhū]) = @[bhāva] = @[bhav]—@[babhav] after reduplication; @[cetaya] (from @[cit]) = @[ceta] = @[cit] = @[cicit] &c.

(b) @[i] is substituted for the @[a] of the reduplicative syllable if the syllable following it be short, and not prosodically long; the @[i] of the reduplicative syllable is lengthened if not followed by a long syl. or a conjunct consonant; thus @[babhav] = @[bibhav] = @[bībhav]; @[cicit] = @[cīcit]; @[skhal] = @[caskhal] = @[ciskhal], the @[i] is not lengthened as it is followed by a conjunct consonant; @[spand] = @[paspand] only, as @[a] is followed by a syllable prosodically long.

(c) Roots having a penultimate @deva[ऋ], short or long, optionally preserve it, the long being changed to the short one; @[vṛt] causal base @[vartaya] = @[vart] after dropping @[aya] and @[a]; by this: @[vart]—@[vavart]; @[vṛt] = @[vart] = @[vit] = @[vivṛt]; @[kṛt]—@[kīrtaya] = @[kīrt] and @[kṛt] by this, @[kīrt]—@[cikīrt]; @[prath]—@[prīprath].

(d) To the base so prepared the augment @[a] is to be prefixed and the terminations added, P. & A., as in the 2nd Variety:—@[abībhavat]–@[ta] from @[bhū]; @[acīcitat] from @[cit]; @[aciskhalat]–@[ta] from @[skhal]; @[apaspandat]–@[ta] from @[spand]; @[avavartat]–@[ta], @[avivṛtat]–@[ta] from @[vṛt]; @[acikīrtat]–@[ta], @[acīkṛtat]–@[ta] fr. @[kṛt]; @[piprathat]–@[ta], @[apīprathat]–@[ta] from @[prath], &c.

N. B. The Atm. form in @[ta] when not given should be supposed to be understood.
