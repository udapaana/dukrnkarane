## § 883. @deva[भुवुद्] is used in the second person like 'you' in English

§ 883. @deva[भुवुद्] is used in the second person like 'you' in English
as a courteous form of address though it is to be regarded as a
pronoun of the third person and ought to be treated as such,
even as @deva[युयुयुयुदु] &c.; @deva[भुवुद्] is used in the sacred texts; @deva[भुवुद् अपि तवु प्रुच्छुयुट्]
you may also go there.

(a) When respect is to be shown, @deva[अयुच्] and @deva[सवु] are prefixed to
@deva[भुवुद्] according as the person with reference to whom it is used
is near, or at a distance or absent; @deva[अत्रुभुवुयुट् कुयुयुयुयुः] the venerable
Kāshyapa (who is near); @deva[इतुयुयुतुनं अट्युकुत्तुरिवुच्युच्युयुवुयुट्] may you.
occupy (lit. ornament) this seat; @deva[तवुभुवुतो द्रुयुयुवुतो] lady Irāvatī
(who is not present); sometimes @deva[युयुट्] is used with @deva[युवुरु] to show
respect; as @deva[युत्युयुयुं विवुयुयुयुविवुयुं स भुवुयुट् निदुयुदुयुट् ।] Māl. Mād. I.
