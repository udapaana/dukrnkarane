rule: §883
---

@[bhavat] is used in the second person like 'you' in English as a courteous form of address though it is to be regarded as a pronoun of the third person and ought to be treated as such,
@[bhavān atra praṣṭavyaḥ] you ought to be asked here, @[bhavān api tatra gacchet] you may also go there.

(a) When respect is to be shown, @[ayam] and @[asau] are prefixed to @[bhavat] according as the person with reference to whom it is used is near, or at a distance or absent; @[ayaṃ bhavān kāśyapaḥ] the venerable Kāśyapa (who is near); @[idamāsanaṃ alaṅkarotvatra bhavān] may you occupy (lit. ornament) this seat; @[asau bhavatī irāvatī] lady Irāvatī (who is not present). Sometimes @[sa] is used with @[bhavat] to show respect; as @[tasmātsvayaṃ vidhīyatāṃ sa bhavān niyujyatām] Mal. Mad. I.
