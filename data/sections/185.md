rule: §185
---

Compounds are divided into four principal classes:—

(1) @[dvandva] or copulative, (2) @[tatpuruṣa] or determinative,
(3) @[bahuvrīhi] or attributive, and (4) @[avyayībhāva] or adverbial.

N. B.—These names @[dvandva] etc. mean nothing i. e. they do not denote any of the characteristics of the different compounds.
They are simply proper names distinguishing the various classes from one another (to which they vaguely refer if they do so at all).
