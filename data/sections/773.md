rule: §773
---

A root may be used in its gerundive form in @[am] with its object prefixed to it if that object be a part of the body which can be severed without fatal effects; @[bhrūsaṃkocaṃ kathayati] 'narrates contracting the eyebrows;' but @[śiraḥ chittvā kathayati] (not @[śiraśchedam]) as the severance of the head would cause death.

(a) Similarly when a part of the body is completely hurt or pressed in the action, the gerund in @[am] is used with that part; @[uraḥpratīpeṣaṃ yudhyante] i.e. @[uraḥ pratīpeṣya pīḍayantaḥ] 'afflicting the whole bosom,' @[urovidāraṃ pratikartuṃ nakhe].
