The cardinal numbers between 100 and 200, 200 and 300, &c. are generally expressed by means of @[ādhika] added to the number showing the excess and then optionally prefixing the whole to 100, 200, &c., e. g. @[ekādhikaṃ śatam] or @[ekādhikaśatam] 101, @[dvādaśādhikaṃ śatam] or @[dvādaśādhikaśatam] 112, @[pañcāśadādhikaṃ śatam] 150, &c. After 1000 this @[ādhika] may be repeated with every multiple of ten or hundred; e. g. @[dvinavatyādhikāṣṭāśatādhikasahasram] 1892, @[ekonacatvāriṃśadādhikaṣaṭśatādhikasaptasaptatisahasrādhikaṃ lakṣam] 177639, &c. Similarly @[uttara] may also be used instead of @[ādhika] e. g. @[catuḥpañcāśaduttaraṃ saptaśatam] 754. Or these may also be, at times, expressed by the copulative particle @[ca] as @[sapta ca śatāni viṃśatiś ca] 720.
