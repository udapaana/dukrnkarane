The particle @[saha] may be compounded with a noun in the Instrumental case in a @[bahuvrīhi] when there is equal participation in some action; in this case @[saha] optionally becomes @[sa]; as @[putreṇa] @[saha] @[vartate] or @[saputraḥ].

(a) @[saha] remains unchanged when the compound involves a blessing but is necessarily changed to @[sa] when followed by a cow, @[vatsaḥ] a calf, or @[hala] a plough, even when a blessing is pronounced; as @[svāsti] @[rājñe] @[sahaputrāya], @[sahāmātyāya], &c.; but, @[savatsāyai], @[sahalāya].
