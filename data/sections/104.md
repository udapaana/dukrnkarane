Nouns derived from the root @[añc] 'to go' by means of such affixes as @[vat], @[van] &c. such as @[prāñc] (@[prā-añc]) eastern, @[pratyañc] (@[prati-añc]) western, @[samyañc] (@[sam-añc]) a companion, @[tiryañc] (@[tiras-añc]) going away, @[samyañc] (@[sam-añc]) going with or well, @[viṣvañc] (@[viṣu-añc]) following, @[devayañc] (@[deva-añc]) adoring a deity, @[sarvayañc] (@[sarva-añc]) going everywhere, @[udañc] northern, @[anvañc] following, @[udyañc], @[bhūyañc]; @[amuyañc] going to that (all these derived from @[adas] + @[añc]), @[prayañc] &c.

(a) In the Nom. sing. @[añc] becomes @[aṅ]. The nasal of @[añc] is dropped before all terminations beginning with the Acc. plu., and the preceding semi-vowel is changed to its corresponding long vowel before the vowel terminations after which @[c] is dropped. When @[añc] is not preceded by a semi-vowel, its @[a] is changed to @[i] if not preceded by a long vowel; otherwise it remains unchanged. @[tiryañc] becomes @[tiryac] under similar circumstances. In other respects these words are declined like words ending in @[c].
