rule: §3

A @[śloka] or stanza consists of four lines each called a @[pāda] or quarter. A @[pāda] is regulated either by the number of syllables (@[akṣara]) or by the number of syllabic instants (@[mātrā]).

(a) A syllable is as much of a word as can be uttered distinctly by one effort of the voice; i.e. a single vowel with or without one or more consonants.

(b) A @[mātrā] is the measure of time required to pronounce a short vowel.
