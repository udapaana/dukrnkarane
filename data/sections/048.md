@[Visarga] preceded by @[a] is dropped necessarily when followed by a soft consonant, and optionally when followed by a vowel; it is also optionally dropped when preceded by @[a] and followed by a vowel except @[a]; when it is not dropped it is changed to @[o] in both these cases; @[devāḥ] + @[namyāḥ] = @[devā namyāḥ]; @[devāḥ] + @[iha] = @[devā iha], @[devo iha].
