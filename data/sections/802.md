@[vid] with @[abhini] governs the Accusative; @[abhinivisate] @[sādhum] he pursues the path of goodness; @[dhanyā] @[sā] @[veśyāntarikā] @[yām] @[eva] @[bhavān] @[mano'bhinivisate] happy is that harlot girl on whom you have fixed your mind (see Bhaṭṭi. VIII. 80.). Rarely this governs the Loc. @[abhinivisate] @[pāpe] fondly resorts to sin. @[viś] with a preposition governs the Acc. but with @[upa] meaning 'to sit' takes the Loc. @[āsane'smin] @[upaviśa] sit on this seat.
