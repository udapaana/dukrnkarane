Decline similarly @[jagattrā] the protector of the world, @[śaṅkhadharā] a conch-shell-blower, @[somapā] one who quaffs the soma-juice, @[dhūmapā] one who inhales smoke, @[baladā] strength-giver or Indra, and other comp. nouns derived from roots ending in @[ā].

(a) If the latter member be not a root the final @[ā] is not dropped; e.g. @[hāhā] name of a Gandharva, Acc. plu. @[hāhān]; I. Ab. G. and L. sing. @[hāhā], @[hāhāḥ]; @[hāhoḥ] and @[hāhāsu] respectively. The rest like @[gopā].
