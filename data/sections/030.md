If a consonant, except @[n] or @[m], coming at the end of a word, be followed by a nasal, the nasal of its class is optionally substituted for it; @[etat] + @[murāriḥ] = @[etanmurāriḥ] and @[etanmurāriḥ] (see § 22 sec. 5.) this Murāri; @[ṣaṭ] + @[māsāḥ] = @[ṣaṇmāsāḥ] and @[ṣaṭmāsāḥ] six months.

N. B.—If the nasal belong to a termination the change is necessary; @[tanmāyam] that alone; @[cinmātram] mere knowledge. @[vāk] + @[maya] = @[vāṅmaya]. The word @[kakudmat] (see Rag. IV. 29.) is irregularly formed.
