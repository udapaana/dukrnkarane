## § 934. Difference Between the Two Futures

The difference between the Two Futures is the same as that between the Imperfect and the Aorist, the only difference being that the former refers to a future time and the latter to a past one.

**First or Periphrastic Future:** Expresses futurity definitely but not of this day.

**Second or Simple Future:** Expresses futurity indefinitely as also that of to-day; it is also employed to denote recent and future contiguous time.

**Examples:**

- @deva[अद्योदयार्णो गः यात्यति कुरै भरतानलिताय] @[adyodayārṇo gaḥ yātyati kurai bharatānalitāya] (Bhaṭṭṛi XXII) oh monkey, to-morrow you will go to Ayodhyā governed by Bharata
- @deva[आत्युयुत्युरस्युयो इण्यु पारायादः शियुयूट् । यातुरः सहं मायुयादो होष्युमि युरैणु रुष्यायः] @[ātyuatyurasyu­yo iṇyu pārāyādaḥ śiyuṣṭ | yāturaḥ sahaṃ māyuādo hoṣyumi yuraiṇu ruṣyāyaḥ] (Bhaṭṭṛi XXII. 14) they will be delighted on seeing you and will ask you questions about the welfare of us two and Sītā; and Bharata also will be greatly pleased
- @deva[एते...उच्यातुयुः कपिकातुनं] @[ete...ucyātuyuḥ kapikātunaṃ] (Kir. III. 22) they will be extirpated by the monkey-bannered one (Arjuna)
- @deva[सत्युयायु पुञ्यालुयो] @[satyuāyu puñyāluyo] (Ś'ak. IV.) Śakuntala will go (goes) to-day
- @deva[यविष्युति जिज्यानै य हतुानुयुयु समु] @[yaviṣyuti jijyānai ya hatunuyuyu samu] (Bhaṭṭṛi XVI. 13) if my sons are killed I will die or kill the enemy, etc.
