The difference between the Two Futures is the same as that between the Imperfect and the aorist, the only difference being that the former refers to a future time and the latter to a past one. The First or Periphrastic expresses futurity definitely but not of this day; the Second or Simple Future expresses futurity indefinitely as also that of to-day; it is also employed to denote recent and future continuous time; as @[ayodhyāṃ adya prāpatsyasi bharatapālitām] (Bhaṭṭi XXII.) oh monkey, to-morrow you will go to Ayodhya governed by Bharata; @[āvābhyāṃ dṛṣṭvā tu harṣam āvayoḥ vṛttam | mātaraḥ saha vaidehyā vakṣyanti ca bharataḥ param] (Bhaṭṭi. XXII. 14.) they will be delighted on seeing you and will ask you questions about the welfare of us two and Sita; and Bharata also will be greatly pleased; @[te naśyanti kapiketanena] (Kir. III. 22) they will be extirpated by the monkey-bannered one (Arjuna); @[yāsyaty adya kuntī] (Sak. IV.) Sakuntala will go (goes) to-day; @[mariṣyāmi jitavān vā ripūn haniṣye nayena mama] (Bhaṭṭi XVI. 13) if my sons are killed I will die or kill the enemy, &c.
