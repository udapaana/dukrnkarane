A preposition, styled '@[upasarga]' or '@[gati],' in Sanskrit is an indeclinable word, having an independent meaning and prefixed to verbs and also to their derivatives. These prepositions modify, intensify and sometimes totally alter the senses of roots:

- @[yasya liṅgaṃ ca vacanaṃ ca sarveṣu kāleṣu ca] @[sadṛśaṃ tad avyayam ity ucyate]
  @[svārādi nipātam avyayam] | Pāṇ. I. 1. 37.

† @[svārthāṃ vācyaṃ kvacit kvacil lam anuvarttate] @[dhātor eva viśiṣṭārthān yathā upasarga gatir vidhiḥ]

Cf. also Sid. Kau. @[upasargeṇa dhātv artho balād anyatra nīyate] @[praharāhāra saṃhāra vihāra parihāravat]

Some think that prepositions have no meaning of their own, but they simply bring to light when prefixed to roots their hidden senses. (cf. Sid. Kau. 15).

@[su] 'to strike,' @[ad] 'to eat, to perform as a sacrifice,' @[aṣ] 'to contract,' @[krīḍ] 'to sport,' @[parihar] 'to avoid, &c.' Sometimes they are prefixed without any alteration in the sense.
