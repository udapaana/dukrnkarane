## § 365. Definition of Prepositions (@deva[उपसर्ग])

A preposition, styled '@deva[उपसर्ग] @[Upasarga]' or '@deva[गति] @[Gāti]' in Sanskrit is an indeclinable word, having an independent meaning and prefixed to verbs and also to their derivatives. These prepositions modify, intensify and sometimes totally alter the senses of roots.
