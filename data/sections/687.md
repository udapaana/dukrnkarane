In the Conjugational Tenses the Parasmaipada frequentatives follow the conjugation of the special base of a root of the 3rd class. @[ī] is optionally prefixed to the terminations of the singulars of the Present, of the 2nd and 3rd singulars of the Imperfect and of the 3rd sing. of the Imperative. When @[i] is prefixed to these, a penultimate short vowel does not take @[guṇa]; @[dā-dādāti] or @[dādīti]; @[dhṛ-dharidhṛti] or @[dharidhṛti] or @[dharīdharti] or @[dharīdhṛtīti] or @[dharidhṛtīti] or @[dharīdhartīti]; @[kṛ-carikṛti] or @[carikṛti], @[carikṛti] or @[carikṛtīti], @[carikṛti] or @[carikṛtīti].
