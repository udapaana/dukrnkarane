§ 793.  (a) When a pronoun is  used  relatively  with  its
noun,  it  must  agree  with  it  in  gender  and  number;  @deva[यः

goes, @deva[यत् फलं तत् फलम्] that  fruit,  &c.

(b) When the nouns are of different genders,  the  pronoun
is put in the masculine  when  they  are  masculine  and  feminine,
and in the neuter when they are  masculine,  feminine  and  neuter.
