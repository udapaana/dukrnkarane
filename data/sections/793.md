rule: §793

The relative pronoun @[yat] neu. sing. is used like the English 'that' to introduce a clause, the gender of the demonstrative pronoun being the same as that of the antecedent noun; @[vidvān api naraḥ anyān vigaṇayati sa dhanamada eva] it is the pride of wealth that even a learned man slights another; @[yathā janodāharaḥ yat saṃpat sampadam anubadhnāti iti] it is a true saying that one good fortune follows another.

Obs.—Sometimes the antecedent noun or pronoun is omitted and has to be inferred from the gender and number of the relative; e.g. @deva[धनेन किं तस्य य ददाति याचके] i.e. @[tasya dhanena], &c. what is the use of wealth to him who does not bestow it on mendicants, &c.
