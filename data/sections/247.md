rule: §247

@[Bahuvrīhi] compounds are divided into two classes, @[samānādhikaraṇabahuvrīhi] and @[vyādhikaraṇabahuvrīhi].†

- @[Anekam anyapadārthe]. Pāṇ. II. 2. 24. @[Samasyamānapadātiriktasya padasya arthaḥ ityarthaḥ]. Ib.

† Strictly speaking this is not a division of the B. but an exception to the general rule. We have given it as a separate division to avoid confusion.

(a) That is a Samānādhikaraṇa Bah. in which both the members are in apposition to each other i. e. have the same case relation when dissolved. There are six kinds of this according as the @[yat] is in any one of the six oblique cases; e. g. @[prāptam udakaṃ yena saḥ prāptodakaḥ śāpaḥ], @[sthitaḥ rathaḥ yena saḥ sthirathaḥ arjunaḥ], @[dattaṃ vittaṃ yasmai saḥ dattavittaḥ rudraḥ], @[uddhṛtaḥ odanaḥ yasyāḥ sā uddhṛtodanā sthālī], @[pītaṃ ambaraṃ asya saḥ pītāmbaraḥ hariḥ], @[vīrāḥ puruṣāḥ yasmin saḥ vīrapuruṣaḥ grāmaḥ].
