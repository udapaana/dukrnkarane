## § 963. Neuter Singulars as Adverbs

The neuter singulars of the Nominative and other cases of several nouns are used as adverbs:

**Examples:**

- @deva[चिरं] @[ciraṃ] or @deva[चिरेण] @[cireṇa] or @deva[चिरात् स्थास्यति] @[cirāt sthāsyati] having contemplated for a long time
- @deva[दुःखं] @[duḥkhaṃ] or @deva[दुःखेन विद्याति] @[duḥkhena vidyāti] he is in distress
- @deva[सुखं] @[sukhaṃ] or @deva[सुखेन] @[sukhena] etc.

**(a) The word @deva[नित्य] @[nitya]** is used adverbially in combination with several words such as @deva[बहु] @[bahu], @deva[नाना] @[nānā], etc.:

- @deva[बहुविध] @[bahividha] in various ways
- @deva[नानाविध] @[nānāvidha] in various ways

The word @deva[पूर्वं] @[pūrvaṃ] is also used adverbially as the latter member of a compound when some action is to be expressed as having happened before something; said something by way of consolation:

- @deva[धृह्यपूर्वं] @[dhṛhyapūrvaṃ] thoughtfully (i.e., thought preceding a certain action)

Example: O venerable Sir, I killed this cow unwittingly.
