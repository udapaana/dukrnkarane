In the case of the causals of roots implying 'motion,' 'knowledge,' 'eating,' roots having some literary work for their object, intransitive roots and the roots @[jalp] and @[bhāṣ] with @[ā]; @[tap] with @[vi], @[vṛt] and @[sthā], their subject in the primitive sense is put in the Accusative case,

@deva[शत्रून् अगमयत् स्वर्गं वेदान् अवेदयत् स्वान् । अमृतं अपाययद् देवान् वेदम् अध्यापयद् विधिम् ॥ आसयत् सलिले पृथ्वीं तं हरिं शरणं गतिः ॥] Sid. Kau.

That venerable Hari is my refuge who despatched the enemies (of gods) to the next world, explained the meaning of the Vedas to his (followers), made the gods drink nectar, taught veda to the Creator and seated the earth (made it rest) on water.

@[darśayati hariṃ bhaktān] he makes the devotees see Hari; @[jalpayati ābhāṣayati vilāpayati munīn devadattaḥ]; @[ahaṃ viṣṇumitram adhyāpayat] (see Ram. I. 52), @[apāyayam amṛtam asurān asurāḥ]. But when the double causal is used the subject ceases to be the subject of the root in the primitive sense and therefore takes the Instrumental; @[gamayati devadattaḥ yajñadattam], @[gamayati devadattena yajñadattaṃ viṣṇumitraḥ].

Obs.—@[dṛś] is sometimes found used with the Dative, @[pratyābhijñānaratnaṃ ca rāmāya adadāt karoti] Ragh. XI. 54.

(a) The causals of @[nī], @[hṛ], and @[vah] when it has for its subject a

- @[gauṇe karmaṇi bhāve ca nīhṛkṛṣvahāḥ] ... @[ādayo matāḥ] Sid. Kau. on Pāṇ. VII. 1. 69.

† @[gatibuddhipratyavasānārthaśabdakarmākarmakāṇām āpe ca karmaṇi sa ṇau]. Pāṇ. I. 4. 52. @[jalpavilapapravādānāṃ ca vyāpyetvāt].

noun other than one denoting a driver, govern the Instrumental of the primitive subject; @[nāyayati pravahatī nā bhāraṃ gā] he makes his servant carry a load; but @[vāhayati tān vāhān sūtaḥ] the charioteer makes the horses draw the chariot.

(1) † The same holds good in the case of the causal of @[aś] and @[khād]; @[āśayati bhojayati vā annaṃ bālena] he makes the boy eat his food.

(2) ‡ @[bhū] when it has not the sense of @[hiṃsā] 'pain or injury to a sentient thing' does the same; @[bhāvayati bālena]; but @[nāśayati kṛṣīvalān sasyam] (when the loss of corn causes pain to the mind).

(3) @[smṛ] and @[dhyā] which denote a kind of knowledge are construed with the Instrumental, though the former when meaning 'to remember with pain' is sometimes found used with the Accusative also; @[smārayati dhyāpayati vā devadattena]; @[na cātra viṣayodbodhaṃ atikrāntapārthivān smārayanti] Raghu. XVI. Vide also Siś. VI. 56.

(4) § The causal of the denominative @[śabdāya] also is construed with the Instrumental; @[śabdayati devadattena] he causes Devadatta to make a sound.

Note:— By intransitive roots are meant such roots as are not capable of governing an object other than one denoting space, time, &c. and not such as, though transitive, may be used without their object being actually expressed; e.g. @[āsayati aśvam]; but @[devadattena pācayati] and not @[devadattaṃ] though the object of @[pac] is not actually expressed.
