**Obs.—** The fem. affix @[ā] or @[ī] at the end of a word forming the first member of a compound is shortened in most cases when the whole is a name or in the Veda; @[kapiñjalāsuraḥ], @[mātariśvaraḥ], @[kumāridāraḥ], @[śraddhidāḥ], @[ajaṅkṣīram] (as @[ajaṅkṣīreṇa hutaḥ]), @[śilāpastham], &c.; but @[nāndīkaraḥ], @[nāndīghoṣaḥ], @[kālakanyāpaurṇamāsī], @[jagatīcchandaḥ], @[somakāṇḍam], &c. The @[ā] or @[ī] is optionally shortened when followed by @[tva]; @[ajatvam], @[ajātvam], @[rohiṇībhūtvam].
