rule: §800
---

Roots having the sense of motion, real or metaphorical govern the Accusative of the place to which it is directed. @[grāmaṃ gacchati] goes to a village; @[adhijyadhanvā vicacāra dāvam] with his bow strung he roamed all over the forest, @[ānandasya parāṃ koṭim anv agacchan] they reached the highest point of joy; @[manasā kṛṣṇam eti] goes to Kṛṣṇa (thinks of him) mentally; @[iti cintayan dhyānād iva nidrāṃ prāpa] while thus pondering he sank into sleep.

(a) When the motion is real, the Dative may also be used; @[grāmāya yāmi vā gacchāmi]; but not of words denoting 'a road;'†

But when the relation of object and verb is expressed by the passive termination the noun forming the object is put in the nominative case, @[hariḥ sevyate].

@[grāmaṃ gacchati] only; but @[pathe gṛhṇāti] he reaches the main road by taking a by-path.
