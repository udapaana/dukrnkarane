Bases with initial vowels:—

(a) If a root begins with a vowel and ends in a single consonant, the consonant is reduplicated and @[i] added to it in the reduplicative syllable: @[aṭ] = @[āṭ] = @[āṭaṭ] = @[āriṭat]–@[ta]; @[ūh] = @[ārihat]–@[ta]; @[ūh] = @[ojihat]–@[ta]; &c.

(b) If it ends in a conjunct consonant with @[n], @[m] or @[h] for its first member, the second member of the conjunct is reduplicated: @[und] = @[undad]--@[undid] and finally @deva[औन्दिदत्]–@[ta] 3 sing, similarly @deva[आन्दिदत्]–@[ta] from @[and] (considered as @[ad], otherwise @deva[आदिदत्]), @deva[आम्हिदत्]–@[ta] from @[amh]; @deva[आञ्जिजत्]–@[ta] from @[añj], &c.

(c) The roots @[an], @[aṅk], @[aś], @[andh], @[aṃs], @[arth] Atm. and some others, substitute @[a] for @[i] in the reduplicative syllable; 3 sing. @deva[आननत्], @deva[आनङ्कत्], @deva[आशशत्], @deva[आनन्धत्], @deva[आंसत्], @deva[आरथत्], &c.
