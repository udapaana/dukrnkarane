The feminine of nouns denoting 'a male' is formed by adding @[ī] when the wife of that male is meant; @[gopaḥ] @[strī] @[gopī]; @[śūdrī] (sometimes @[śūdrāṇī] also) 'wife of a Śūdra'.

(a) but not of nouns ending in @[pālaka]; as @[gopālikā] 'the wife of a cowherd' (but @[gopāla] has @[gopālī]); @[aśvapālikā] 'the wife of a horse-groom'.

(b) @[sūrya] has @[sūryā] 'the divine wife of Sūrya;' but @[sūrī] i.e. @[kuntī] who was a mortal.
