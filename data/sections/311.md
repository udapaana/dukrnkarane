## § 311. Optional Treatment of Case-Endings

@deva[विभाषा सुपो बहुलम्] @[vibhāṣā supo bahulam]

Optionally, and in various ways, case-endings (@deva[सुप्] @[sup]) may be treated differently.

**Obs.** This acknowledges that there are variations in how case-endings are handled in the formation of Avyayībhāva compounds, and that usage may vary.
