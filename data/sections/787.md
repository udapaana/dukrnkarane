rule: §787
---

When an indeclinable used with an adjectival force takes the place of the verb, the object governed by it is put in the Nominative case. @[vṛkṣo'pi saṃvardhya svayaṃ chettumasāmpratam] (Kom. II. 55.) it is not fit to cut down even a poisonous tree having first reared it up; here the indeclinable @[ayuktam] is equivalent to @[na yujyate] and the whole sentence to @[svayaṃ saṃvardhya taṃ vṛkṣaṃ chettumasāmpratam (na yujyate) yo'pi viṣavṛkṣaḥ syāt].

**Concord of the Adjective with the Substantive.**
