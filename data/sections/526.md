The Periphrastic perfect is formed by adding @deva[आम्] to the root and then adding the forms of the reduplicated perfect of @deva[कृ], @deva[भू], or @deva[अस्] as terminations; when the forms of @deva[अस्] are added, a Parasmaipadi root takes the Parasmaipadi forms and an Atmanepadi one takes the Atmanepadi forms.
