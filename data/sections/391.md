rule: §391

Roots of the tenth or @[curādi] class add @[aya] before the personal terminations. Before @[aya] (1) the penultimate short vowel (except @[a]) takes the @[guṇa] substitute; and the final vowel and the penultimate @[a] not prosodially long, take their Vṛddhi substitute; e.g. @[cud] + @[ti] = @[cud] + @[aya] + @[ti] = @[codayati]; @[luḍ] + @[ti] = @[loḍayati], @[pad] + @[aya] + @[ti] = @[pād] + @[aya] + @[ti] = @[pādayati]; @[tāḍ] + @[aya] + @[ti] = @[tāḍ] + @[aya] + @[ti] = @[tāḍayati]; but @[daṇḍ] + @[aya] + @[ti] = @[daṇḍayati], &c.
