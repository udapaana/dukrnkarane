rule: §50

(a) The @[s] of the nom. sing. of @[eṣa] and @[etad] masc. is dropped before a consonant when they do not end in a comp. or are not used in a negative @[tatpuruṣa]; e.g. @[sa hariḥ]; @[eṣa viṣṇuḥ]; but @[eṣako rudraḥ] this Rudra; @[asaddhikāraḥ] that is not Śiva (a neg. Tat.); @[eṣo'tra].

(b) Sometimes in poetry the @[s] of @[saḥ] and @[eṣaḥ] is considered as not existing when followed by a vowel other than @[a], so that the two vowels may combine in order to meet the exigencies of the metre; e.g. @[sa imā bhuvanī pracarati] Ṛg. I. 24. 1.

@[sa eṣa dāśarathī rāmaḥ sa eṣa rājā yudhiṣṭhiraḥ]
@[sa eṣa kathayā mahātmā sa eṣa bhīmo mahābalaḥ]
