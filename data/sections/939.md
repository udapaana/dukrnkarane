The Simple Future is alone used when the idea of hope is conveyed by @deva[लिङ्] @[liṅ] and words having the sense of @deva[लिङ्] @[liṅ]:

**Example:**

@deva[ऋतिदानां अत् स्वाति वा यास्यति शीघ्रं बस्यायः] @[ṛtidānāṃ at svāti vā yāsyati śīghraṃ basyāyaḥ] if a shower were to come quickly we would at once sow corn.
