A noun in the Locative is compounded—

(a) † with @[śikṣita], @[śuṣṭa], @[pakva] & @[kṛta], @[pravīṇa], @[suśikṣita] adorned, invested with, @[antara], @[āḍhya], @[paṭu], @[paṇḍita], @[snāta], @[capalā], @[nipuṇa], @[siddha], @[dakṣa], @[pakva], and @[bandha]; as @[akṣeṣu śauṇḍaḥ akṣaśauṇḍaḥ] skilled in dice, but also @[īśvarādhīnaḥ] dependent on God (when compounded the affix @[a] i.e. @[īna] is compulsory; so the compounded form is always with @[adhīna]); @[ātapaśuṣkaḥ] dried in the sun; @[sthālīpakvaḥ] cooked in a pot; @[cakrabandhaḥ] a kind of poetic composition; &c.

(b) ‡ with words meaning a 'crow' when contempt is implied; @[tīrthe kākaḥ iva tīrthakākaḥ] said in contempt of one who is very greedy; so @[tīrthakākaḥ]; similarly @[nagarakākaḥ-vāyasaḥ] &c. &c.

There are a few Loc. Tat. compounds given in the list @[kūpasamitādi] having a similar sense; e. g. @[kūpe maṇḍūka iva kūpamaṇḍūkaḥ] a well-abiding frog i. e. one who knows nothing of the world.

† @[saptamī śikṣitādiṣu | siddhaśuṣkapakvabandhebhyaśca] Pāṇ. II. 1. 40, 41.

‡ @[dhavādibhyaśca kṣepre | kūpasamitādyāśca] Pāṇ. II. 1. 42, 43. @[cakāro'vadhāraṇārthaḥ | tenaiṣāṃ samāsānte ṣaṣṭhaṃ vā] Sid. Kau.
