rule: §819

The primary sense of the Dative case is @[saṃpradāna] (@[saṃpradānam]). The indirect object of the root @[dā] is called @[saṃpradāna]; also the person or thing with reference to whom or which an action is done; @[viprebhyo gāṃ dadāti] 'he gives a cow to a brāhmaṇa,' @[yuddhāya saṃnahyate] 'prepares for battle,' @[na śūdrāya dharmaṃ brūyāt] 'The Śūdra should not be instructed in the veda,' &c.

But in the case of the root @[yaj] the proper object is put in the Instrumental case and the indirect object in the Accusative, @[rudrāya vṛṣabhaṃ yajate] 'he sacrifices a bull to Rudra.'

Note:—Though the root @[dā] ought to govern the Dat. of the indirect object, it is sometimes found used with the Gen. or the Loc. @[rājyaṃ vibhajati te vai dadāmi tava khecara] 'O sky-wanderer, I will give you the prosperous kingdom of the Śibis;' @[yas tvam rāme pṛthivīṃ dātum icchasi] 'thou who art thinking of bestowing the earth upon Rāma,' &c.
