## § 310. Later Elements Fixed in Avyayībhāva

@deva[समासान्तः पराः अव्ययीभावे] @[samāsāntaḥ parāḥ avyayībhāve]

At the end of an Avyayībhāva compound, the later elements (@deva[पर] @[para]) become fixed.

**Obs.** This means that once an Avyayībhāva is formed, it becomes invariable and indeclinable.
