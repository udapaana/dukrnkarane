rule: §916

The root @[arh] 'to deserve' when used (in the second person) in combination with the infinitive expresses 'a request, a respectful entreaty,' and is generally equivalent to the English 'I pray, be pleased, &c.;' @[agniṃ śāmayitum arhasi] (Meg. 56) please put out the fire; @[na ced rahasyaṃ prativaktuṃ arhasi] (Kum. V. 40) if you have nothing to conceal from me, please answer me; @[divasān dvān trīn ārhasi lokena] (Rag. V. 26) pray wait for two or three days, O respectable one! &c. Sometimes it is equivalent to a gentle command; @[kuntīṃ prasādayituṃ arhasi] (Rag. I. 89) you ought to please her, @[na taṃ śocituṃ arhasi] you ought not to bewail him. In the third person and under the same circumstances it expresses power or ability and can be translated by 'can;' @[droṇaṃ hi samare ko'nyo yoddhuṃ arhati phalgunāt] Mah. Bhar. IV. 58. 27. @[daive prajñāviśeṣeṇa kaḥ pratyudyatuṃ arhati] Ibid I. 1. 246.
