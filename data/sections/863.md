With superlatives, and words having the sense of the superlative, the Genitive is used; @[etāsāṃ brāhmaṇaḥ śreṣṭhaḥ]; @[agraṇīr mantra-kartṝṇām] (Ragh. I. 4.) the chief of sages, the authors of the Mantras.

Note:—Words having the sense of comparatives are used with the Ablative and sometimes with the Instrumental; @[ayam asmād balena hīnaḥ] or @[adhikaḥ] this person is superior or inferior to him in strength; similarly @[devadatto yajñadattāt paṭuḥ vā]; @[ke svantataraḥ mayā] who will have a happier end than I? The word @[adhika] is used with the Genitive, the Locative or the Instrumental; @[teṣāṃ putrāṇām adhikataro'bhavat] he was more (i. e. dearer) to them than their sons; @[pañcavarṣāṇi māsāḥ pañca dvādaśa rātrayaḥ] they passed five months and twelve nights more than (those years); @[kuḍave'dhikaḥ prasthaḥ] a Prastha is larger than a Kuḍava.
