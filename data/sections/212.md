rule: §212
---

@[pūrva], @[apara], @[adhara], @[uttara] and @[ardha] &c. are compounded with nouns in the Genitive expressive of the whole and are placed first; e.g. @[pūrvaṃ kāyasya pūrvakāyaḥ] the forepart of the body; @[aparakāyaḥ adharakāyaḥ] &c. @[ardhaṃ pippalyāḥ ardhapippalī]; but @[grāmārdhaḥ] as (@[ardha] is mas. here)

N. B.—In order that the above rule should hold the noun expressive of the whole must denote a single object; hence @[pūrvaḥ śiṣyāṇām] the first among pupils, @[ardhaṃ pippalīnām] half of a number of pippalis &c, and not @[pūrvaśiṣyaḥ] &c.
