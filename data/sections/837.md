(a) The teacher from whom something is learnt regularly is put in the Ablative case; @[upādhyāyād adhīte] 'learns from the preceptor'; but @[narasya gāthāṃ kṛṇoti].

(b) Similarly the prime or original cause in the case of @[jan] 'to be born,' and the source in the case of @[pra sū] are put in the Ablative; @[brahmaṇaḥ kṣatrāt prajāyante] 'the creation proceeds from brāhmaṇa'; @[gomayāt vṛściko jāyate] 'the scorpion is born from cowdung'; @[himavataḥ gaṅgā prasavati] 'The Ganges rises from the Himalayas'; @[kāmāt krodho abhijāyate] 'from desire anger is produced.'

Note:—Verbs meaning 'to be born' or 'to be begotten upon' are often used with the Loc.; @[tasyāṃ śatānanda āṅgiraso 'jāyata] 'from her was born Śatānanda Āṅgirasa'; @[menakāyām utpannaṃ] 'begotten upon Menakā'; See Manu Smṛ. 154, I. 9.
