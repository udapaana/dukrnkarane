Before this @[ya],

(4) final @[o] and @[au] are changed to @[av] and @[āv]; @[go]-@[gavyati]; @[nau]-@[nāvyati].

(5) a final nasal is cropped and the preceding vowel is changed like an original final vowel; @[rājan]-@[rājīyati] 'he wishes for a king.'

(6) in other cases the final consonant remains unchanged; @[vāc]-@[vācyati] 'he wishes for words,' @[div]-@[divyati] (@[dīvyati] according to some) 'he wishes for heaven,' @[yūpa]-@[yūpīyati] 'he wishes for holy sticks,' &c.

(7) The Tad. affix expressing 'a descendant of' is dropped and then the changes mentioned above take place, @[mārgam] (the son of @[garga]) @[ātmanaḥ] @[icchati] @[gārgīyati] (@[gārgya + ya + ti] = @[gārga + ya + ti] = @[gārgī + ya + ti]), &c.
