§ 880.  * When  '  contempt  or  disregard'  is  to  be  shown,  the
Genitive  or  the  Locative  Absolute  is  used;  @deva[नरुनै  निरुनुयूनुयुयुयुयुत  वा  उनु
उन्युयु  वा  याञुयुञित]  he  turned  out  a  recluse  disregarding  or  despis-
ing  son  i.  e.  in  spite  of  the  weeping  of  his  son.  In  this  sense
the  Genitive  Absolute  is  used  more  often.  The  Locative  or  the
Genitive  absolute  may  thus  have  the  sense  of  'in  spite  of,'
'notwithstanding,'  &c.  in  English.

(a)  The  Locative  Absolute  be  made  to  express  the  idea  of
'as  soon  as,'  'no  sooner  than,'  'the  moment  that'  &c.  by
compounding  it  with  the  word  @deva[एवु]  or  @deva[मावु];  @deva[निसिमुत्युच्]...@deva[संहिनुयुयुयुड्  एवु]
(Rag.  XVI.  78.)  no  sooner  was  the  arrow  fixed,  &c.  @deva[आवुदुसित]-
@deva[वुचुनं  एवु  मम्]  scarcely  had  I  finished  my  speech  when.
