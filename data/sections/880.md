rule: §880

When 'contempt or disregard' is to be shown, the Genitive or the Locative Absolute is used; @deva[रुदति पुत्रे वा एनं चरन्तं तात प्राव्राजीत्] he turned out a recluse disregarding his weeping son i.e. in spite of the weeping of his son. In this sense the Genitive Absolute is used more often. The Locative or the Genitive absolute may thus have the sense of 'in spite of,' 'notwithstanding,' &c. in English.

(a) The Locative Absolute is made to express the idea of 'as soon as,' 'no sooner than,' 'the moment that' &c. by compounding it with the word @[eva] or @[mātra]; @deva[तस्मिन्...संहितमात्र एव] (Ragh. XVI. 78.) no sooner was the arrow fixed, &c. @deva[अनवसित-वचन एव भयमपि] scarcely had I finished my speech when.
