## § 308. First Member Retains Original Form

@deva[पूर्वपदप्रकृत्यैकत्वे] @[pūrvapadaprakṛtyaikatve]

When the first member retains its original form (@deva[प्रकृति] @[prakṛti]), it is treated as one unit.

**Obs.** This principle governs how the first member of an Avyayībhāva maintains its basic stem form throughout the compound.
