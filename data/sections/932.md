With the particle @[purā] not joined with @[sma], the aorist, the Imperfect, the perfect or the Present may be used. @[atra ete purā brāhmaṇasya śiṣyā abhūvan avātsīḥ avasad duduvaḥ] (Sid. Kau.) here formerly dwelt pupils. But when @[sma] is used with @[purā] the present alone can be used; @[yajati sma purā] he formerly sacrificed.
