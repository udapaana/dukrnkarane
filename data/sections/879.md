The Locative or Genitive Absolute may be used to express the sense of the English particles 'when, while, since, although,' &c. (and may thus supply the place of a pluperfect tense); @[evaṃ tayoḥ parasparaṃ vadatoḥ]; While they two were thus talking; @[punaḥ sūrye udite yāvān bāhyaḥ ity akṣeṣam] (Megh. 40); Thou wilt accomplish the rest of thy journey when the sun rises again.
