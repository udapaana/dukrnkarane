The sense of the reflexive pronoun is, in Sanskrit, expressed by the word @deva[आत्मन्] 'self', which is invariably used in the masculine gender and singular number, and by the reflexive adverb @deva[स्वयम्] e.g. @[tāḥ sarvāḥ svapneṣu vāmanaiḥ]

"they all (the wives of Daśaratha) saw in dreams that they were guarded by dwarfs," @[sa] or @[sā kṛtāparādhaḥ] (or @[kṛtāparādhā]) @[rājā svayaṃ kṣamāṃ yācate] or @[jagāma], &c.
