rule: §339

The @[taddhita] affixes are added in various senses. They occasion various changes in the words to which they are added. The following general observations should be paid attention to.

(a) As a general rule the first vowel of a word takes its @[vṛddhi] substitute before the terminations @[a], @[ya], @[ika], @[īna], @[eya], @[sva], &c.; as @[aśvapati + a = āśvapati + a].

(b) Before terminations beginning with a vowel or @[y] (1) the final @[a], @[ā], @[i], and @[ī] are rejected; (2) @[u] and @[ū] take their @[guṇa] substitute; (3) @[o] and @[au] obey the ordinary rules of @[sandhi]; @[āśvapati + a = āśvapata] 'belonging to Aśvapati,' &c. m.n.; @[manu + a = mānavaḥ] &c. 'descendant of Manu'; @[go + ya = gavyaṃ] 'belonging to a cow', so @[nāvya] fr. @[nau] &c.

(c) In the case of derivatives from compound words sometimes the initial vowel of the second word takes its @[vṛddhi] substitute, and sometimes the @[vṛddhi] is optional; @[pūrvavārṣika] 'belonging to the last year'; similarly @[paurāṇika] &c. @[audanvat] fr. @[udan], @[saubhāgya] from @[subhāgya], &c. When these terminations are added to a @[dvandva] comp. both the words of which are the names of deities, @[vṛddhi] is substituted for the initial vowel of both; @[āgnīmāruta] 'a sacrifice offered to Agni and the Marut deities,' &c.

(d) If the initial vowel of a word be preceded by the @[i] and @[u] of a preposition the @[i] or @[u] is first changed to @[iy] or @[uv] before @[vṛddhi] substitute can take place; as @[vyākaraṇa + a = viyākaraṇa + a = vaiyākaraṇaḥ]; @[upadhāna + a = uvadhāna + a = aupadhānikaḥ]; similarly @[aupasthika] from @[upastha], @[aupaniṣadika] fr. @[upaniṣad], &c.

(e) Before consonantal @[taddhita] affixes, a final @[n] is generally rejected; the final @[n] with the preceding vowel is sometimes dropped before vowel terminations and before such as begin with @[y]; @[yuvan-yuvatva], @[rājan-rājaka], &c. @[ātman-ātmya-ātmīya]. There are various exceptions to this latter part of the rule; e.g. @[rājanya] fr. @[rājan] &c.

N. B.—Other changes the student will easily note from the instances given.
