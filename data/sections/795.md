§ 795.  When the antecedent is  of  the  dual  or  the  plural
number, the correlative  pronoun  in  the  principal  clause  may
be omitted, and  the  verb  put  in  that  number  of  which  the
antecedent is:  @deva[ये पुरुषाः तव सुता वा  वस्त्युकुटायुमुगुच्युछुन्ति]  or  @deva[ये
पुरुषाः तव सुताः ते गुच्छुन्ति]  those  men  who  are  your  sons  go
( in the first  sentence  the  correlative  pronoun  @deva[ते]  is  omitted
and the verb, though  governed  by  an  antecedent  in  the  rela-
tive clause,  is  made  plural ).
