There are several indeclinables in Sanskrit which also govern cases. Cases governed by indeclinables are called @[upapadavibhakti]s, as distinguished from those governed by verbs which are called @[kārakavibhakti]s. In cases where both are possible the latter predominates over the former (@[upapadavibhakteḥ kārakavibhaktir balavattarā]); as in @[grāmaśrayaṃ yajate] although @[grāma] alone would govern the Dative.
