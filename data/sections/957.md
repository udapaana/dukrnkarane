¶ When in a conditional sentence one thing is expressed as depending upon another as effect upon a cause, the Potential or the Simple Future may be used; @[yadi kṛṣṇaṃ praṇamet sukhaṃ vrajet] or @[yāsyāt] if he will bow to Kṛṣṇa he will attain happiness: so @[kṛṣṇaṃ praṇamati sukhaṃ vrajet yāsyati].
