## § 856. * The Genitive is used subjectively and objectively

§ 856.  * The  Genitive  is  used  subjectively  and  objectively
with Kṛidantas or  Primary Nominal  Bases  derived  by  means
of the Kṛit affixes (i  e.  is  used  in  the  sense  of  the subject  or
the object of the action denoted  by  the  Kṛidantas); @deva[युयुणुयुस्युरु  छुति]:
an act of Kriṣhṇa i. e. of which Kṛishṇa is the agent; @deva[जुगुतुः क्तुर्त्तुयुयु]
the Creator  of  the  world,  which  is  the  object  of  the  action:
denoted  by  the  noun  @deva[क्तुर्त्तुयुयु];  similarly  @deva[सुतुनों  याट्युकुः]  the  protector  of
the good; @deva[यवुयुस्  वरं]  will  be  the  similies  of  mṛiti;  @deva[मुयु  कुवेः  किंनुयुयु] a  work
of that  poet;  @deva[सारुयुर्णो  दुहितुरुनं  न  भायुट्].  (Rāmacharita  XII.  117.).
This is  not  a  common  creation  of  Brahman.
