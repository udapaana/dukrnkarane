rule: §856
---

The Genitive is used subjectively and objectively with Kṛdantas or Primary Nominal Bases derived by means of the @[kṛt] affixes (i.e. is used in the sense of the subject or the object of the action denoted by the Kṛdantas); @deva[कृष्णस्य कर्म] an act of Kṛṣṇa s.e. of which Kṛṣṇa is the agent; @deva[जगतः कर्ता] the Creator of the world, which is the object of the action denoted by the noun @[kartṛ]; similarly @deva[सतां पालकः] the protector of the good; @deva[पयसः पानम्] the drinking of milk; @deva[तस्य कवेः क्रिया] a work of that poet; @deva[साधारणी क्रिया न ब्राह्मणस्य] (P-Amaracarita XII. 117.) This is not a common action of brāhmaṇa.

(a) In the case of verbs governing two Accusatives the secondary object of the Kṛdanta may be put in the Genitive or in the Accusative; @deva[नेताश्वस्य स्रुघ्नस्य वा] (Sid. Kau.) the taker of the horse to Sṛghna.

(b) When the agent and the object of the bases derived by means of @[kṛt] affixes are used in a sentence, the object is put in the Genitive case and not the agent; @deva[आचार्यस्य गवां दोहनमाश्चर्यम्] the milking of cows by one who is not a cowherd is a wonder.

Exceptions.—This rule does not apply to @[kṛt] nouns ending in the affixes @[ṣṇuk] and @[ṇvul] when feminine; @deva[रुद्रस्य भेदिका वा भेदनं जगतः] (Sid. Kau.) the desire of Rudra to split the universe or the splitting of the universe by Rudra. According to some when the @[kṛt] affixes are of feminine gender, and according to others
