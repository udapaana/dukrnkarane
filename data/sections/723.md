The roots @[i] i.e. P. 'to go', @[stu], @[śās], @[pac] 6. P. A. @[han], @[yaj], and roots having a short vowel for their penultimate, except @[hṛṣ] and @[tṛṣ], take the affix @[kyap] (@[ya]) in the same sense as @[yat]. When a root ends in a short vowel, @[t] is inserted between the final vowel and the affix @[ya]; e.g. @[i]—@[etya] 'worthy of being approached,' @[stu]—@[stutya] 'deserving praise,' @[śās]—@[śiṣya] 'fit to be instructed;' @[pac]—@[pakya]; @[han]—@[hanya]; @[yaj]—@[iṣṭya] 'worthy of being served,' @[vṛdh]—@[vardhya]; @[labh]—@[labhya] 'fit to be increased as wealth, &c.' but @[kḷptya] (@[kḷp] + @[yat]) 'able,' @[chad]—@[chadya] (@[chad] + @[ṇyat]) 'that ought to be teased or hurt.'
