A @[pratipadika] ending in @[u] not preceded by @[y] and denoting mankind forms its feminine in @[ū]; e.g. @[kurūḥ] 'a woman of the Kuru country'; but @[adhvaryūḥ] 'the wife of an Adhvaryu'; also when it does not denote animal-kind; as @[alābūḥ], @[kakaṇḍūḥ]; except in the case of @[rajju] and @[hanu]; @[rajjuḥ]; @[hanuḥ].

(a) Obs.—A @[pratipadika] ending in @[bāhu] and used as a proper name, and the word @[peṭī] also form their feminine in @[ū]; as @[bhadrabāhūḥ] 'a woman of that name'; but @[vṛttabāhuḥ] 'a woman having well-rounded arms'; @[peṭanūḥ].
