Adjectives ending in @[u] not preceded by a conjunct consonant, except @[svaru], take @[ī] optionally, e.g. @[mṛdu] - @[mṛduḥ] - @[mṛdvī], @[guruḥ] - @[gurūḥ] - @[gurvī], @[bahuḥ] - @[bahvī]; but @[svaruḥ] 'a girl who chooses her husband' (@[vaṃśīvarā kanyā] Sid. Kau.); @[pāṇḍuḥ] and not @[pāṇḍvī] as the @[u] is preceded by a conjunct consonant; @[ākhuḥ] as it is a noun.
