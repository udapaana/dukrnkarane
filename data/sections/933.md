## § 933. Aorist with Prohibitive Particle

The Aorist is used with the prohibitive particle @deva[मा] @[mā] (@deva[माट्] @[māṭ]) or @deva[मा स्म] @[mā sma], with the temporal augment @deva[अ] @[a] cut off, and has then the sense of the Imperative:

**Examples:**

- @deva[हरिं ते चन्यनं मा मात] @[hariṃ te canyanaṃ mā māta] (Me. Bhā.) do not insult Hari

The text includes notes about expressions of sorrow or anger (here the अ is not dropped); sometimes it is dropped, as in @deva[मायुर्यूः स्वास्युनां] @[māyuryūḥ svāsyunāṃ] do not despise your soul (conscience).

Some explain these anomalies by considering the particle to be @deva[मु] @[mu] and not @deva[माट्] @[māṭ].
