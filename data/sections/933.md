The aorist is used with the prohibitive particle @[mā] (@[māṅ]) or @[mā sma], with the temporal augment @[a] cut off, and has then the sense of the imperative; @[mā te saṃśayo bhūt] Ma. Bha. V. 182. 16. have no doubt &c. @[mā sma pratilomam agamaḥ] do not go against. Rarely in ancient works the augment is retained @[mā niṣāda pratiṣṭhāṃ tvam agamaḥ śāśvatīḥ samāḥ] may you not live, oh Nishada for many years. When a root is preceded by a preposition, the @[a] is sometimes not dropped; @[mā manyum anvagāḥ] do not submit to sorrow or anger (here the @[a] is not dropped); sometimes it is dropped; as in @[mā avamansthāḥ sva ātmānam] do not despise your soul (conscience). Some explain these anomalies by considering the particle to be @[mā] and not @[māṅ].
