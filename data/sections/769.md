With the words @[samūla], @[akārya] and @[sajīva] are used respectively the gerunds in @[am] of the roots @[han], @[kṛ] and @[grah] in cognate sense; @[samūlaghātam hanti] 'kills destroying the roots i.e. totally'; @[akāryakāram karoti] 'does what ought not to have been done;' @[sajīvagrāham gṛhṇāti] 'captures him so as to preserve him i.e. alive.'

(a) The gerund of @[han] and @[piṣ] is used with words signifying instruments (of action); @[pādaghātam hanti] = @[pādena hanti] 'strikes (kicking) with foot,' @[udapeṣam pinaṣṭi] = @[udakena pinaṣṭi] 'grinds with (using) the water.'

(b) Similarly the gerund of @[vṛt] and @[grah] is used with @[hasta] and its synonyms, and that of @[grah] with @[sva]; @[vastavartam vartayati]; so @[karavartam], @[hastena calikām karotītyarthaḥ] Sid. Kau; @[hastāgraham gṛhṇāti]: similarly @[pāṇigrāham], @[karagrāham], &c.
