rule: §24
---

@[e], @[o], @[ai] and @[au], when followed by a vowel, are changed to @[ay], @[av], @[āy], and @[āv] respectively; e. g. @[hare] + @[e] = @[haraye] for Hari; @[viṣṇo] + @[e] = @[viṣṇave] for Viṣṇu; @[nai] + @[akaḥ] = @[nāyakaḥ] A leader, @[pau] + @[akaḥ] = @[pāvakaḥ] the purifier i. e. fire.

(a) @[e] or @[o] at the end of a word and preceded by @[a] or @[ā] is optionally dropped when followed by a vowel or a soft consonant; e. g. @[hare] + @[ehi] = @[harayehi] or @[hara ehi]; @[viṣṇau] + @[iha] = @[viṣṇaviha] or @[viṣṇa iha]; @[dhiye] + @[udyataḥ] = @[dhiyāyudyataḥ] or @[dhiyā udyataḥ] intent on getting money; @[guro] + @[utkaḥ] = @[gurāvutkaḥ] or @[gurā utkaḥ] longing to see the preceptor.

Note—Two vowels brought together by the disappearance of an intervening consonant or @[visarga] do not coalesce.

(b) @[o] and @[au], when followed by a termination beginning with @[y], become @[āv] and @[āv] respectively; e. g. @[go] + @[yam] = @[gāvyam] produced from a cow as milk, ghee &c. @[nau] + @[yam] = @[nāvyam] accessible by a boat, navigable.

N. B. This rule holds good, in the case of roots, only when the @[e] or @[o] is brought in by virtue of a termination; e. g. @[lu] + @[ya] = @[lo] + @[ya] = @[lavyam] fit to be lopped off. @[ava] + @[sya] + @[la] + @[yam] = @[avasya] + @[la] + @[yam] = @[avasyalavyam] which ought necessarily to be cut off.

(c) The @[o] of the word @[go] is also changed to @[av] when followed

by the word @[yuti] (in the veda and) in ordinary language when it means a particular measure of length; e. g. @[go] + @[yuti] = @[gavyuti] four miles.

(d) The @[e] of the roots @[ci] and @[ji] is changed to @[ay] when followed by the @[ya] of the potential participle indicating capability; e. g. @[ci] + @[ya] = @[ce] + @[ya] = @[cayya] what can be reduced; @[ji] + @[ya] = @[jayya] what can be conquered; but @[tyājya] @[yojya] @[jñeya] (what is fit to be removed but may not be so) @[dhārya], @[jeya] (what ought to be curbed but which it may not be always possible to curb as) @[kāmaḥ].
