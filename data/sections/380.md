§ 380. In § 378 ( b ) three are marked plus abhūta; vāc, the first may be termed the Special Tenses ( @deva[विशेषण] ) and the rest the Common Tenses or Lakāras ( @deva[विशेषण] ). The special Tenses undergo peculiar modifications ( @deva[विकरण] ) and these are therefore called Vikarna-lakāras : the others Sakārānta-lakāras ( @deva[सकारान्त] ).
