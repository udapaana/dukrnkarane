rule: §860
---

In the case of words denoting equality or likeness, such as @[sadṛśa], @[sama], &c., the person or thing with whom or which any object is compared is put in the Genitive case, except in the case of @[tulā] and @[upamā]; @[tulyaḥ] @[sadṛśaḥ] @[samaḥ] @[vā] @[asau] @[kṛṣṇena] @[vā] equal to or like Kṛṣṇa; @[ko'nyo'sti] @[sadṛśo] @[mama] who else is equal to me? but @[kṛṣṇasya] @[tulā] @[upamā] @[ca] @[nāsti] (Sid. Kau.).

Obs.—The words @[tulā] and @[upamā], however, are found used by good authors with the Instrumental against Pāṇini's rule; @[yat] @[yādṛścalam] @[prāpti] @[vṛntatvośasā] (Kum. 5, 34.) which rises to the high position of being compared with your lip, @[sphuṭam] @[upamāṃ] @[tatra] @[bhasitena] @[arhati] (Śiś. 1. 4.) clearly deserving to be compared with Śambhu white with ashes; see Ragh. VIII. 15.
