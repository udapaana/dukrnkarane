## § 860. † In the case of words denoting equality or likeness,

§ 860.  † In  the  case  of  words  denoting  equality  or  likeness,
such  as  @deva[तुल्युयु],  @deva[सदुशु],  &c.,  the  person  or  thing  with  whom  or  which
any  object  is  compared  is  put  in  the  Genitive  case,  except in
the  case of  @deva[तुल्युयु]  there is no  compulsion;  @deva[युयुणुस्युयु  कृष्णुस्युयु  वा]
equal  to  or  like  Kṛishṇa;  @deva[कोऽन्युयोऽस्युत  सदुशुयो  मम]  who  else is equal
to  me?  but  @deva[छुयुयुस्युरु  तुल्युयो  उयुयुयु  वा  नारिंङु] (Sid.  Kau.)

Obs.—The  words  @deva[तुल्युयु]  and  @deva[उयुयुयु],  however,  are  found  used  by
good  anthers  with  the  Instrumental  against  Pāṇini's  rule;
@deva[तुल्युयो  यवुरुयुहेनं  वनुयुवुयुसु]  (Kum.  V.  34.)  which  rises  to  the  high
position  of  being  equal  with  your  lip;  @deva[स्तुनुयुयुर्युं  अतिरुक्तुनं
शुङुबुनु]  (Siṣ.  I.  4.  ,) clearly  deserving  to  be  compared  with  Ś'ambhu
white  with  ashes;  see  Rag.  VIII.  15.
