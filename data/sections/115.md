## § 115. The Nom. and acc. dual @deva[उषसी], the nom. voc. and

§ 115. The Nom. and acc. dual @deva[उषसी], the nom. voc. and
acc. pl. @deva[उषसः] are formed regularly by adding the case-affixes. So
also @deva[कर्तासौ] and @deva[कर्तासः] ( nom. pl. ) and @deva[कर्तासः] ( acc. pl. ). Simi-
larly the dat., abl. and loc. dual of both these words will be
formed as follows: @deva[उषोभ्याम्] and @deva[कर्तोभ्याम्], @deva[उषसोः] and @deva[कर्तसोः ॥]
Similarly also we have the ins. @deva[कर्तासा ॥] But in the ins. of
@deva[उषस्] we have @deva[उषसा] by virtue of the special rule @deva[वाष्प]-@deva[अदभ्यष्प्राच्वराब्वि]-
@deva[भ्यो निचा] ( Pan. VI. 4. 116 ). So also we have @deva[उषसे], @deva[उषसः], @deva[उषसः]
and @deva[उषसि], though the @deva[गुण ओ] ought to be substituted for @deva[अ] by
virtue of the general rule @deva[प्रत्ययस्य लुकि तद्धितलुकि च गुणः ॥] But
the @deva[गुण] is not admitted here by virtue of the rule @deva[पच्यदात्] of
Vār. ( quoted in the Kāsikā on VI. 4. 116 ). The Gen. dual should
have been @deva[उषोः] by VI. 4.
