rule: §275

The words @[pāra] and @[madhya] optionally form Avys. compounds with any nominal base, and are placed first, the final a being changed to e when thus compounded; e.g. @[gaṅgā-pāre-dhāre] 'from the middle of the Gangetic stream;' optionally of course, the Gen. Tat.; also @[gaṅgāpārāt], @[gaṅgāmadhyāt]. In this case the Ab. termination is irregularly retained. If the final noun has the sense of the Loc. the final vowel may be changed to e; as @[pāre-madhye-gaṅge]; cf. @[gaṅgāyām] Bhaṭṭi. I. 4.
