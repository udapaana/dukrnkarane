rule: §878

When the action done or suffered by a person or thing indicates another action i.e. when the time of the happening of the one action which is known indicates that of the second action, the Locative Absolute is used; @[goṣu duhyamānāsu gataḥ] he went away while the cows were being milked; @[avasannāyāṃ rātrau] the night being ended; @[kuto dharmakriyāvighnaḥ satāṃ rakṣitari tvayi] whence can there be obstacles to our religious rites when thou art the protector of the good.
