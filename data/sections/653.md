Before this affix the final @[a] of a nominal base is lengthened, @[ā] remains unchanged, other final letters undergo the same changes as they do before the other @[āya] (@[kyac]). The final @[as] of a noun is changed to @[āya] optionally and that of @[apsaras] and @[ojas] necessarily. @[kṛṣṇa iva ācarati]--@[kṛṣṇāyate] 'he acts like @[kṛṣṇa];' @[yaśas]--@[yaśāyate], @[yaśasyate] 'he behaves like one who is famous,' @[vidas]--@[vidāyate], @[vidasyate] 'he acts like a learned man', &c.; but @[ojas]--@[ojāyate] 'acts like one who is lustrous' (powerful); @[apsaras]--@[apsarāyate] 'she behaves like an Apsaras.'

(a) A feminine noun not having @[a] for its penultimate drops its fem. term., @[kumārī iva ācarati]--@[kumārāyate] 'he behaves like a girl,' @[hariṇī iva ācarati hariṇāyate] 'she acts like a female deer'; @[sthūlī iva ācarati sthūlāyate] 'acts like a stout woman.' But @[pācikā iva ācarati pācikāyate] 'she acts like a female cook,' and not @[pācakāyate].

(b) @[sapatnī] has @[sapatnāyate], @[sapatnīyate] and @[sapatnīyate] 'she acts like a co-wife,' @[yuvati] has @[yuvāyate] 'she behaves like a young woman.'
