rule: §786
---

When a substantive or an adjective is used predicatively with verbs of incomplete predication such as 'to grow, to seem, to be, to appear,' &c. the substantive or adjective so used must agree with the subject in case; @[eṣa me niścayaḥ] this is my resolve; @[sa rājarṣiḥ jāgrābhiḥ kṛśaḥ lakṣyate] that king seems emaciated through wakefulness; @[trilokīśo bhavitum icchati] desirous of being the lord of the three worlds.

(a) The same rule applies to transitive roots of incomplete predication used passively; @[tena muninā sa mūṣakaḥ biḍālaḥ kṛtaḥ] by that sage the mouse was made (transformed into) a cat, &c.; @[rājā hi viṣṇuḥ manyate] a king is thought to be Viṣṇu.
