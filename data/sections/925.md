## § 925. Three Past Tenses in Sanskrit

In Sanskrit there are three tenses denoting a past action, viz. the **Imperfect**, the **Perfect**, and the **Aorist**.

Originally each of these three tenses had a signification of its own and was used in its proper sense in ancient writings.

After Sanskrit ceased to be a spoken language the exact senses of these tenses were lost sight of and writers began to use them promiscuously, so that now any of these may be used to denote past time with certain limitations.

The original senses of these as well as their other peculiarities are noticed below.

**Note:** For a further explanation of the difference between these three tenses the student is referred to Dr. Bhāṇḍārkar's preface to the 1st Edition of his 2nd book of Sanskrit.
