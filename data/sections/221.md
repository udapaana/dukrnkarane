(a) A word expressive of the standard of comparison (@[upamānam]) may be compounded in a Karmadhāraya with another denoting the common quality or ground of comparison; as @[megha iva ghanasyāmaḥ] dark like a cloud. Such compounds are called @[upamānapūrvapadakarmadhārayaḥ].

(b) Similarly a noun denoting the person or thing compared (@[upameyam]) may be compounded with words indicative of excellence, such as @[vyāghraḥ], @[siṃhaḥ], @[ṛṣabhaḥ], @[vṛṣaḥ], &c. the common attribute (of similarity) being made; as @[puruṣo vyāghra iva] = @[puruṣavyāghraḥ] a man like a tiger (i.e. as bold as a tiger); @[mukhaṃ candra iva] = @[mukhacandraḥ] a moon-like face i.e. as delightful as the moon; @[netraṃ kamalam iva] = @[netrakamalam] &c.; these are called @[upamānottarapadakarmadhārayaḥ].

‡ @[upamitaṃ vyāghrādibhiḥ sāmānyāprayoge] | Ibid. II. 1. 56.

§ All these words are included under what is called the group of @[vyāghra]. The more important of these words are @[vyāghra], @[siṃha], @[śarabha], @[ṛṣabha], @[candana], @[vṛṣa], @[varāha], @[hastin], @[ruru], @[ṛkṣa], @[puṇḍarīka], &c.; @[candra], @[padma], @[kamala], @[kumuda], &c.; cf. @[syuruttarapade vyāghrapuṃgavarvṛṣabhāḥ jarāḥ | siṃhārdūlanāgāryā ṛṣāthargo carāḥ ||] Amara III. 1. 59.

**Note 1.**—The difference between the two is this:—In the former the common quality of comparison is actually expressed; while in the latter it is left to be understood; in fact if it be expressed there can be no compound; as @[puruṣaḥ vyāghra iva sāhasī] |

**Note 2.**—The above Karmadhārayas may be dissolved as @[candraḥ iva mukhaṃ mukhacandraḥ], @[kamalaṃ iva netraṃ netrakamalam], &c. Dissolved in either way there will be no difference in the formation of the compounds; but there will be difference both in the meaning and in the metaphor. In one case prominence will be given to @[candra] or the moon and the figure will be '@[upamā] (a simile)' while in the other to @[mukha] or the face in which case the figure will be '@[rūpaka].' Compounds like @[pādaṃ eva padmaṃ] = @[pādapadmam], @[vidyā eva dhanaṃ] = @[vidyādhanam], &c. are termed @[avadhāraṇapūrvapadakarmadhārayaḥ].
