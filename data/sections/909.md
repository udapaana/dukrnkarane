## § 909. Indeclinable Past Participles or Gerunds

The past indeclinable participle in Sanskrit denotes the prior of two actions done by the same agent and corresponds to the perfect participle in English; @deva[हतं उक्त्वा विरार] @[hataṃ uktvā virāra] having said this he stopped; @deva[तान् पृष्ठापिश्य नहुषं नीत्वा सवासौति] @[tān pṛṣṭhāpiśya nahuṣaṃ nītvā savāsauti] having seated them on his back, he carried them to the lake and ate them up.

As the past indeclinable participles or gerunds serve the purpose of carrying on the action of the verb and act as connecting links between sentences, they account for the sparing use made in Sanskrit composition of relative pronouns, conjunctions and connecting particles. When several powers are used the gerund should be translated by verbal tenses and copulative conjunctions; @deva[यच्छने पङ्गोरकानं चन्द्रापीडः पत्यायाम्नं रात्रंमलं गत्वा पित्रः समायं सदहतं निज्ञो च विलासवतो आस्याय यासिवुदनं यर्षितछविद्यस्ने] @[yacchane paṅgorakānaṃ candrāpīḍaḥ patyāyāmnaṃ rātraṃmalaṃ gatvā pitraḥ samāyaṃ sadahataṃ nijño ca vilāsavato āsyāya yāsivadunaṃ yarṣitachavidyasne] when the evening time approached, Chandāpīḍa went to the royal palace on foot, remained in the presence of his father for an hour, saw Vilāsavatī, &c.
