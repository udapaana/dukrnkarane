@[yadi] and @[cet] 'if' are usually used with the Potential or the conditional; as @[yadi so'tra saṃnihito bhavet tadā mama sāhāyyaṃ kuryāt] if he were here he would assist me; @[yadi devadatto bhaviṣyan idānīm etad akariṣyat] had Devadatta been here, he would have undoubtedly done this; but they are also construed with the Present Indicative; @[yadi jīvati śobhāṃ prāpsyati] if he lives he will see prosperity; @[yadi mayā devapādānāṃ prayojanam asti] if Your Majesty has any thing to do with me, &c.; @[satyam brūhi mama jīvitena cet tvaṃ vācā na kathayasi] I conjure you by my life if you will not tell it in words. @[cet] is never used at the beginning of a sentence; @[api cet sahasrakiraṇo dhruvam ādhiyuktas syāt] (Śāk. VII. 4) if the thousand-rayed one (sun) did not place him at the yoke of his car; @[api roṣam āśritya no cet] &c. Bha. G. I. 44.
