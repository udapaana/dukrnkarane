## § 961. The Conditional Mood

The Conditional is used in those conditional sentences in which the Potential may be used when the non-performance of the action is implied or in which the falsity of the antecedent is involved as a matter of fact. It expresses both future and past time. It must be used in both the antecedent and the consequent clauses.

**Example:**

If ever there would be plentiful rain there would be an abundance of corn.

**Example (with Sanskrit):**

@deva[यदि पूर्णिमासस्यात्तेनात्तरो गायतु तर्हि तच्चार्थो कार्यानि] @[yadi pūrṇimāsasyāt­tenā­ttaro gāyatu tarhi taccārtho kāryāni] had you obtained (which you have not) the sweet fragrance of her breath, would you have had any liking for this lotus?

**Pāṇini Reference:** @deva[लिङ्लिविधौ छट् पादिविधो] @[liṅli­vidh­au chaṭ pādividho] (Pāṇ. III. 3. 139)

The commentary explains: When the Potential (@deva[लिङ्] @[liṅ]) is used in conditional constructions, the Conditional (@deva[छट्] @[chaṭ]) may be used instead when the action's non-performance is the presupposition.
