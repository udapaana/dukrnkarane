Syntax deals with the mode of arranging words in sentences. Of the three divisions of Syntax—Concord, Government and Order, the Syntax of Sanskrit is mainly concerned with the first two. Syntax in English depends principally upon the last. In Sanskrit and other cognate languages which are rich in inflection, the relation, which one word bears to another in a sentence is determined by its grammatical form, and no change occurs in the meaning of the sentences, how-so-ever the order of words be changed. But in English and other languages, deficient in inflection, 'order' is everything. Change the order of words and there is a corresponding change in the meaning. In Sanskrit, therefore, the mere order of words is not of material importance, though a perfect arbitrariness in that respect is not allowable. Sanskrit Syntax also takes further into account the meaning and use of particles, the various tenses of verbs, and participles.[^1] These will be treated of in their proper order.

## Footnotes

[^1]: As the great bulk of Sanskrit literature is thrown in the form of verses, the laws of Syntax will be found to be in many ways observed by the poets. In ordinary prose writings the usual order of words in a sentence is, first the subject with its adjuncts, then the object with its adjuncts, then the adverbs and other indeclinables (extensions of the predicate) and lastly the predicate. The chief characteristics of Sanskrit verse are, in the words of Prof. Max Müller, "the predominance of co-ordination, the use of the Locative Absolute, a fondness for compounds and indeclinable participles supplying the place of subordinate clauses, the frequent employment of the Past Participle instead of the finite verb, a preference for verbal forms, and the absence of the indirect construction and of the subjunctive mood. For the latter reason the use of the tenses and moods is comparatively simple, on the other hand, the use of the cases, being much more definite than in Latin and Greek presents some difficulties.'
