## Predicate Forms: Participle, Adjective, or Noun

The predicate may not always be a finite verb; but a participle, or an adjective or a noun may take its place.

(a) When a participle is used as the predicate it must agree with the subject in number and gender; @deva[स तदुक्तवान्] he said that, @deva[सा तदुक्तवती] she said that, @deva[तेषां बन्धनानि छिन्नानि] their bonds were cut off, @deva[कर्म कृतम्] the work is done, @deva[लता छिन्ना] the creeper is cut; &c.

(b) When an adjective or a noun is used as the predicate, a form of the roots @deva[भू] or @deva[अस्] may be used with it or may be omitted; the adjective used predicatively agrees with the subject in number and gender; words like @deva[आस्पद], @deva[पात्र], @deva[भाजन], @deva[स्थान], @deva[पद] &c. retain their gender and number; @deva[सुभृत्यः दुर्लभः] a good servant is difficult to be obtained, @deva[सुपुत्रः पितुः गर्वास्पदम्] a good son is the object of his father's pride, @deva[सम्पदः पदमापदाम्] riches are the abode of miseries, @deva[स तु तस्या अभिमानभूमिः] &c.; in these cases the verb agrees with the subject in number and not with the noun used predicatively; @deva[सम्पदः आपदां पदं सन्ति] and not @deva[अस्ति], &c.
