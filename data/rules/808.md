## Causative Verbs: Subject in Accusative Case

In the case of the causals of roots implying 'motion,' 'knowledge,' 'eating,' roots having some literary work for their objects, intransitive roots and the roots @deva[हन्] and @deva[जल्प्], @deva[भू] with @deva[आङ्]; @deva[ह्वे] with @deva[हि], @deva[यच्] and @deva[छु], their subject in the primitive sense is put in the Accusative case.[^1]

@deva[शत्रुद्विगुमयर्थं वैदशं स्वक्तनेदयद् ।]
@deva[आवासयच्छं देवान् अपाययद् अमृतं ।]
@deva[आध्यापयत् कमलं पृथिव्यां यः ते स भवेद् हरेः ॥] (Sid. Kau.)

That venerable Hari is my refuge who despatched the enemies (of gods) to the next world, explained the meaning of the Vedas to his (followers), made the gods drink nectar, taught Vedas to the Creator and seated the earth (made it rest) on waters.

@deva[दैत्यान् हरिं मनाते] he makes the devotees see Hari; @deva[जलपति सपरे विद्यमानं यत्नवान् यच् मैत्रकगुरुमहोत्सवः] (R. Kum. I. 82). @deva[अध्यापयति यत्किंचित्]. But when the double causal is used the subject ceases to be the subject of the root in the primitive sense and therefore takes the Instrumental; @deva[रामयति देवदत्तः यत्रेद्त्तं], @deva[गच्छयति देवदत्तेन यत्र्देवनं विष्णुदेवतः]

Obs:— @deva[दृश्] is sometimes found used with the Dative; @deva[यत्त्विङोगुलं स दंङतिर्य] (Rag. XII. 54).

(a) The causals of @deva[नी], and @deva[वह्] when it has for its subject a noun other than one denoting a driver, govern the Instrumental of the primitive subject; @deva[नायति वाहयति वा भारं यरथेन] he makes his servant carry a load; @deva[यरुंचयति रथं वाहानं यत्तः] the charioteer makes the horses draw the chariot.

(b) The same holds good in the case of the causal of @deva[अद्] and @deva[सह्]; @deva[आदयति यत्विदेन न अन्नं वट्नं] he makes the boy eat his food.

(c) @deva[यच्], when it has not the sense of @deva[हिंसा] 'pain or injury to a sentient thing' does the same; @deva[भुक्तयेच्चन् वट्नं]; but @deva[भुक्तयति वघोरदेवरे सस्यं] (when the loss of corn causes pain to the mind).

(d) @deva[स्मृ] and @deva[स्मार] which denote a kind of knowledge are construed with the Instrumental in the Atm. @deva[भोनं यत्तेन यत्त्वरेद्वयच] when meaning 'to remember with pain' is sometimes found used with the Accusative also; @deva[स्मरयति भीषयति वा देवदत्तं]; @deva[अरिघं चैद्यानो अतिकुञ्चेषिश्यषकेनेरे स्मार्यन्ते प्रकटीः]. Vide also Siṣ. VI. 66.

(e) The causal of the denominative @deva[घुच्र] also is construed with the Instrumental; @deva[घुच्रवयति देवदत्तेन] he causes Devadatta to make a sound.

Note:—By intransitive roots are meant such roots as are not capable of governing an object other than one denoting space, time, &c. and not such as, though transitive, may be used without their object being actually expressed; @deva[भारं आरयति देवदत्तं]; but @deva[देवदत्तं गच्छयति] and @deva[यदयति] though @deva[यदतं] and @deva[देवदत्तं एवं] is not actually expressed.[^2]
