As already remarked (See @ref[54]) there are three numbers in Sanskrit: a singular number, denoting a single individual, a dual number denoting two, and a plural number denoting more than two. Besides these general senses—

(a) The singular may be used to denote a class; @deva[सिंहः शार्दूलानाम्] the lion is the king of beasts; @deva[मुक्तामणिरत्नेषु नरः श्रेष्ठः] &c.

(b) The dual sometimes denotes the whole of the same class; @deva[पितरौ] parents; @deva[चाटकौ] a male and a female sparrow.

(1) Note:—Words like @deva[द्वन्द्वं], @deva[द्वितयं], @deva[द्वा], @deva[युगम्], &c. meaning 'a pair,' &c. which are dual in sense but singular in form ought to be always used in the singular, except when several pairs are meant.

(2) Note:—Words like @deva[हस्तौ], @deva[नेत्रे], @deva[पादौ], &c. should always be used in the dual in Sanskrit.

(c) The plural, like the singular, may represent a class, @deva[ब्राह्मणाः पूज्याः] (or @deva[ब्राह्मणः पूज्यः]) Brāhmaṇas (i. e. the Brāhmaṇa class) are adorable.

(1) The plural is not unfrequently used as a mark of respect or reverence. @deva[भवन्ति श्रीशङ्कराचार्याः] so (says) the venerable Śaṅkarāchārya; @deva[भूतं आचार्यगुणाः] this is the opinion of the reverend preceptor, &c.

(2) In the first person, great personages and writers sometimes use the plural instead of the singular; @deva[वयमपि भवन्तो किमपि पृच्छामः] we (i. e. I,) too ask you something; @deva[भूतं तु वयं] but we (i. e. I, the writer) hold this opinion; @deva[वयमपि च निराकुर्मः] we rule over speech (i. e. language).

(3) Words like @deva[द्रव्यं], @deva[धनं], @deva[अश्वदाः], @deva[शिक्ताः], @deva[आयुः], @deva[गुणाः], @deva[द्राजाः], &c. are always used in the plural, though some of them are singular in sense.

(4) Names of countries which are really the names of the people inhabiting them, must be used in the plural, @deva[स विदेहान् जगाम] he went to Videha, &c.

But in the case of compounds ending in words denoting a country, such as @deva[देश], @deva[विषय], &c. the sing. must be used; @deva[आसीत् मगधेषु पाटलिपुत्रं नाम नगरम्] there is a town called Pāṭaliputra in the country of Magadha.

(5) The plural of proper nouns denotes a family or race as in English; @deva[जनकानां रघूणां च वंशस्तं गोत्रमङ्गतम्] Utt.
