## Predicative Agreement with Verbs of Incomplete Predication

When a substantive or an adjective is used predicatively with verbs of incomplete predication such as 'to grow, to seem, to be, to appear,' &c. the substantive or adjective so used must agree with the subject in case; @deva[इदं मम व्रतम्] this is my resolve; @deva[स भूपतिः प्रजागरकर्शः लक्ष्यते] that king seems emaciated through wakefulness; @deva[प्रभुर्बुभूषुर्भुवनत्रयस्य] desirous of being the lord of the three worlds.

(a) The same applies to transitive roots of incomplete predication used passively; @deva[तेन मुनिना स मूषकः विडालः कृतः] by that sage the mouse was made (transformed into) a cat, &c.; @deva[नृपे हि विष्णुः मन्यते] a king is thought to be Vishnu.
