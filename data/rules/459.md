Roots ending in @deva[इ], @deva[ऋ], and @deva[ओ] are to be treated as roots ending in @deva[अय]. Also roots of @deva[त्री] 3 Â. 'to kill,' @deva[सि] 4 Â. 'to perish,' before a termination causing Guṇa or Vṛddhi; @deva[सि] 9 P. 4 Â. 'to adhere or cling to' changes its vowel to @deva[अय] optionally under the same circumstances.
