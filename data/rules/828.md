## Dative with Implied Infinitive

The object governed by an infinitive mood not actually used but implied, is put in the Dative; @deva[फलाय याति] i.e. (@deva[फलं हर्तुं]) 'goes for (in order to bring) fruits;' @deva[नृसिंहाय प्रणामः] (i.e. @deva[आराधयितुम्]) 'We bow down to Nṛsiṁha (to propitiate him)'

(a) The Dative of an abstract noun formed from a root may be used to express the sense of the Infinitive of the same root; @deva[यज्ञाय याति] 'goes to perform a sacrifice;' @deva[त्यागाय संचायर्णों] (Rag. I. 7.) 'who had amassed wealth in order to give it away,' &c.[^1]
