## Neuter Gender Idiom for Adjectives

(a) Sometimes an adjective does not agree with its noun in gender &c. but is put in the neuter gender. This is an idiom of the Sanskrit language: @deva[सर्वं देवदत्तः] all Devadatta is, @deva[स नाम महद् गुणौघोपेतः] he was possessed of a great multitude of virtues.

(b) When the adjective is put in the neuter gender it may be used either in the singular or in the plural according to the noun it qualifies @deva[सर्वाः स्त्रियः] all the women, @deva[सर्वाणि सत्त्वानि] several living beings, &c.
