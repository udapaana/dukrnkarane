## SECTION V.

## Indeclinables.

## ADVERBS.

The neu. singulars of the Nominative and other cases of several nouns are used as adverbs; @deva[चिरम्] or @deva[चिरेण] or @deva[चिराय स्मस्य] having contemplated for a long time; @deva[दुःखम्] or @deva[दुःखेन विद्यापि] he is in distress; so @deva[दूरम्] or @deva[दूरेन] &c.

(a) The word @deva[विध] is used adverbially in combination with several words such as @deva[बहु], @deva[नाना], &c.; @deva[बहुविध], @deva[नानाविध] in various ways. The word @deva[पूर्वम्] is also used adverbially as the latter member of a compound when some action is to be expressed as having happened before something; said something by way of consolation; @deva[ध्यात्वापूर्वम्] thoughtfully, (i. e. thought preceding a certain action); @deva[अबुध्यपूर्वं मृगत्वदारेण हता च भो] O venerable Sir, I killed this cow unwittingly; @deva[शरणेन अध्यायनम्] &c.
