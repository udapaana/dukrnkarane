## Reduplication in Ātmanepada Frequentatives

The reduplication syllable is formed between the reduplicative syllable and the radical consonant:

@deva[पृट्]—@deva[पूर्यंय] = @deva[पुपूर्यंयते]

@deva[भञ्ज्]—@deva[भुञ्जय] = @deva[पुञ्जयते]

@deva[पृञ्]—@deva[परीयते]

@deva[मृड्] = @deva[मरीयते]

### Conjugation of the Ātm. Freq. Base

In the Conjugational Tenses the Ātm. Freq. Base is conjugated like the Conjugational base of the 4th class in Ātmanepada. In the General Tenses, and in all the Tenses of the Passive, the base loses its final @deva[य] when the base + @deva[अ] is preceded by a vowel and drops the @deva[य] itself when it is preceded by a consonant.

As regards the Perfect, the Freq. Base takes the Periphrastic Perfect. In the Aorist the Ātm. terminations of the 5th form are added. In the remaining Tenses the Ātm. terminations with the intermediate @deva[इ] prefixed to them are added as usual. The Passive is also formed like the Passive of derived verbs.

### Paradigms

The 3rd sing. of @deva[बोबुध्] the Ātm. Freq. Base of the root @deva[बुध्] and @deva[देदीय] that of the root @deva[द्या]:

| Tense | Active (@deva[बोबुध्]) | Active (@deva[देदीय]) | Passive (@deva[बोबुध्]) | Passive (@deva[देदीय]) |
|-------|------|------|---------|---------|
| Present | @deva[बोबुध्यते] | @deva[देदीयते] | @deva[बोबुध्यते] | @deva[देदीय्यते] |
| Imperfect | @deva[अबोबुध्यत] | @deva[अदेदीयत] | @deva[अबोबुध्यत] | @deva[अदेदीय्यत] |
| Imperative | @deva[बोबुध्यताम्] | @deva[देदीयताम्] | @deva[बोबुध्यताम्] | @deva[देदीय्यताम्] |
| Potential | @deva[बोबुध्येत] | @deva[देदीयेत] | @deva[बोबुध्येत] | @deva[देदीय्येत] |
