## Strong and Weak Terminations in Perfect

The Parasmaipada singular terminations are strong; the rest weak. Before the strong terminations the penultimate short vowel takes its @deva[गुण] (@[Guṇa]) substitute. The final vowel and penultimate @deva[अ] take @deva[वृद्धि] (@[Vṛddhi]) necessarily in the third and optionally in the first person singular. In the 2nd person singular the final vowel takes @deva[गुण] (@[Guṇa]) and the penultimate @deva[अ] remains unchanged.
