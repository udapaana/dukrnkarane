## Genitive with Verbs of Business/Gambling

The roots @deva[व्यवह्] (i. e. @deva[वह्] with @deva[नि] and @deva[अत्]), @deva[व्यय] and @deva[वि] when they all mean to transact business, or to stake in gambling, govern the Genitive of their object; @deva[शतस्य व्यवहरति] invests a hundred rupees in business; @deva[गोभिर्व्ययन्ति] he staked his life; @deva[अदेवीत् भ्रातृभिः] lost his brothers and pleasures in gambling, &c.; but when @deva[वि] is preceded by a preposition, the Accusative may also be used; @deva[शतस्य शतं वा प्रतिदशति] (Sid. Kau.)[^1]
