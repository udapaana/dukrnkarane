As @deva[अथ] marks the beginning, so @deva[इति] marks the close of a composition. This particle is used in the following senses; (1) to quote the exact words spoken or spoken to, it is placed at the place of the quotation marks and being used generally after the words quoted; [^1] @deva[इति विज्ञप्त्यन्नाहार्यन्यन्तु शकान्युनैयु दैवे विज्ञापयनै. देवदत्तछन्दाकाहारितुहिम्युयूमि दैव्यारादुनैच्यातिष्ठामुविहन्यो] । 0 man a certain Chandaka girl requests Your Majesty to command * If who have come to your majesty's feet wish to enjoy the happiness of the sight of Your Majesty;' @deva[प्रायः अच्यतः लुकायः स्त्री इति प्रायनीयु इति] are two have accomplished one object; @deva[इत्यनुमानं ष्यत्] (@deva[राया]); (2) cause (rendered in English because, since &c.); @deva[यदैदेशकोस्मीति पृच्छामि] I ask you because I am a foreigner; @deva[प्रारायणैनं न वाद्यं युनै] every thing is not good simply because it is old; (3) purpose or motive; @deva[ये लुयूयूयूयूनुयूति परिरुयुयूयूवितुयुयूयूर्णो] they have come to a limited number of servants with them that there should be no disturbance, &c.; (4) so, thus; as follows; @deva[प्रायनैयुयुनुयूयूयू हुरिरुयूयूनुयूयू युयूवु].

## INTERJECTIONS.

[^1]: In Sanskrit there is no indirect construction, so that in translating indirect constructions the actual words of the speaker followed by @deva[इति] must be used.
