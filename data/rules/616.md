## Formation of Desiderative Base by Reduplication

The Desiderative base is formed by reduplicating the root or base according to the general rules of reduplication given at @ref[444]-@ref[448] and @ref[549] (c) (h), and by adding @deva[स्] (which may by changed to @deva[ष्] according to the rules of Sandhi) to it. The @deva[अ] of the reduplicative syllable is changed to @deva[इ].

**Example:**
@deva[चर्]—@deva[चचर्]—@deva[चिचर्+स]=@deva[चिचरिष्] by the following rule.

@note[type=note]{The @deva[स्] of a primitive root is not changed to @deva[ष्] when the characteristic @deva[स्] is changed to @deva[ष्]; @deva[सम्]—@deva[सिस्मिष्], @deva[सिव्]—@deva[सिस्विष्], @deva[स्व]—@deva[सुस्वः]); @deva[स्ना]—@deva[सिस्नासिष्]; @deva[स्वप्]—@deva[सुस्वप्सिष्]; @deva[स्था]—@deva[तिष्ठासा]; @deva[स्थिव]—@deva[तिष्ठीविष्], @deva[स्फायि] (सु); @deva[स्फारि]; @deva[स्वप्], however, forms @deva[सुषुप्सिष्].}

@note[type=note]{A root takes a Desiderative form only when the agent of the wish and of the action expressed by the root is the same; so @deva[हिंस्यां पदन्] @deva[इति] @deva[इच्छति] @deva[छः] and not @deva[पिपदिषति]; also the sense of the root must be the object of the wish: @deva[गमनं] @deva[इच्छति] cannot, therefore, be equal to @deva[जिगमिषति]}

@note[type=note]{Though the Desiderative form of a root is not to be met with often enough to assume a classical character as a verb, yet nominal and participal derivatives from it are not uncommonly to be met with.}
