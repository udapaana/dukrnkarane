The final @deva[नु] of the base is optionally dropped before @deva[म्] and @deva[व्] if it is not preceded by a conjunct consonant. It is changed to @deva[ण] before a weak termination beginning with a vowel, if preceded by a conjunct consonant and to @deva[न] in other cases. The @deva[हि] of the Imperative 2nd per. sing. is dropped after @deva[नु] not preceded by a conjunct consonant.
