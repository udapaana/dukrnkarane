In a compound, as a general rule, words are simply joined together, without any relation between the component parts being actually expressed; the whole compound word has the power to express the various relations that exist between the several parts. The last word only takes the case termination required by its grammatical position in a sentence, the remaining words (those ending in a consonant) generally assuming their crude forms before the consonantal case terminations; e. g. @deva[विद्युत्] + @deva[जनः] = @deva[विद्युज्जनः] (see below), @deva[राजन्] + @deva[पुरुषः] = @deva[राजपुरुषः], &c.
