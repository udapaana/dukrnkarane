In the General Tenses and Moods and in the formation of verbal derivatives generally, the augment @deva[इ] is prefixed (necessarily or optionally) to terminations beginning with any consonant except @deva[य] in the case of certain roots. Such roots as take the augment @deva[इ] necessarily are called Seṭ (@deva[स]+@deva[इट्] i. e. with @deva[इ]); such as take it optionally are called Veṭ (@deva[वा]+@deva[इट्]), and those that do not, are called Aniṭ (@deva[अन्]+@deva[इट्] i. e. without @deva[इ]).
