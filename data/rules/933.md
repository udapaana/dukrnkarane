The Aorist is used with the prohibitive particle @deva[मा] (@deva[मुङ्]) or @deva[मा स्म], with the temporal augment @deva[अ] cut off, and has then the sense of the Imperative; @deva[हरिं ते चन्द्रादनं मा कार्षीः] Me. Bhā V. 132. 16. have nothing to do with that; similarly @deva[मा रोषं प्रकाशीः] Bhā V Rarely in ancient works the augment is retained @deva[मा निषादप्रतिष्ठां त्वमगमः शाश्वतीः समाः] may you not live, oh Nishāda for many years. When a root is preceded by a preposition, the @deva[अ] is sometimes not dropped; @deva[मा नु प्रवक्ष्यन्मन्युशोकम्] do not submit to sorrow or anger (here the @deva[अ] is not dropped); sometimes it is dropped; as in @deva[मात्मानं स्मावमानीः] do not despise your soul (conscience). Some explain these anomalies by considering the particle to be @deva[मा] and not @deva[मुङ्].
