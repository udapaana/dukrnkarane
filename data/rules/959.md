Sometimes the Potential is used without a subject when it is used in the sense of 'a precept or advice'; @deva[आपदर्थं धनं रक्षेत् रक्षेद्धनैरपि स्त्रियम्। आत्मानं सततं रक्षेद्धनेनापि स्त्रिया।] ॥ ('a man) should save money for adversity, he should serve his wife at the cost of his wealth and himself even at the expense of his wife and wealth; @deva[प्रियोजनान् विश्वावतान्नार्पयेदमत्सरः] (Obs) should serve Brāhmaṇas with all that they like, without being jealous.
