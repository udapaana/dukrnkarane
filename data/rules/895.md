The use of the perfect participles is very limited; it is used in the sense of 'who or what has done &c.'; @deva[तं तस्थुषं नगर्याभिमुखम्] (Rag. V. 61.) him who had halted in the vicinity of the city; @deva[तस्य] (S'ak V. II. 9.) @deva[समस्तकल्याणवहस्य] (Mag. V. 34.) of thee who hast obtained all good things, @deva[स शुशुरुतस्तस्य वचनम्] (Bhattṛi. I. 20) when he heard his words, &c.
