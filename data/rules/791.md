## Adjectives Treated as Neuter Substantives

When an adjective is preceded by a word used in the sense of 'a certain' or when it qualifies an adjective used as a noun, it is treated as a substantive and generally put in the neuter; @deva[किंचिद्रूपम्] something beautiful, @deva[किंचिद् गम्भीरम्] something deep, @deva[अल्पं गुरु] something important, @deva[दृढतरम्] something very hard.

(a) But such expressions as @deva[सुरूपोऽयं], @deva[दृढरूपोऽयं] are also used.
