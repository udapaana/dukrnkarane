Neither Guṇa nor Vṛddhi is substituted for the vowel of a few roots of the 6th class even before a strong termination except the @deva[स्य] of the 1st and 3rd person sing. of the Perfect, the @deva[सीय] of the causal and the @deva[स्य] of the 3rd pers. sing. of the Passive Aorist. These are @deva[इच्], @deva[युच्], @deva[इच्छ], @deva[वच्], @deva[व्यच्], @deva[स्वर्], @deva[स्पृश्], @deva[मृश्], @deva[स्पृश्], @deva[यश्], @deva[वि], @deva[वु], @deva[कु]; and a few more not often to be met with.[^1]

[^1]: These couplets as well as those bearing on the 2nd variety of the Aorist are composed by Mr. Chintāmaṇa Ātmārām Kelkar, one of the learned Śāstris of the Poona Training College.
