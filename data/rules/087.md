## SECTION II.

## BASES ENDING IN CONSONANTS.

Bases ending in any of the first four letters of a class, and in @deva[ण्], @deva[र्], @deva[श्], @deva[ष्], @deva[स्], @deva[ह्] and @deva[ह्]. The declension of these bases consists, for the most part, in adding the general case terminations and observing the rules of sandhi.
