The following couplet (Kārikā) gives a rule for the correct use of these pronouns:—

@deva[इदमस्तु सन्निकृष्टं समीपतरमभति चैतदो रूपम् ।]
@deva[अदसस्तु विप्रकृष्टं तदिति परोक्षे विजानीयात् ॥]

@deva[इदम्] is used with reference to a person or thing near at hand, and @deva[एतद्] to one nearer still; @deva[अदस्] is used of a person or thing at a distance, while @deva[तद्] is used of one that is absent.
