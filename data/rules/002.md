The Devanāgarī alphabet consists of forty-two letters or @deva[वर्ण] (@[varṇa]), nine vowels or @deva[स्वर] (@[svara]), and thirty-three consonants or @deva[व्यञ्जन] (@[vyañjana]).[^1]

These express nearly every gradation of sound, and every letter stands for a particular and invariable sound.

**Note:** This explains why there are no names, as in Greek, for the different letters of the alphabet.

[^1]: Thus given by Pāṇini:—
  1. Vowels
    @deva:
    अइउण् ।
    ऋऌक् ।
    एओङ् ।
    ऐऔच् ।
    :@

  2. Consonants
    @deva:
    हयवरट् ।
    लण् ।
    ञमङणनम् ।
    झभञ् ।
    घढधष् ।
    जबगडदश् ।
    खफछठथचटतव् ।
    कपय् ।
    शषसर् ।
    हल् ।

  The alphabet, it will be seen, is divided into 14 sections by Pāṇini, which are called @deva[शिवसूत्राणि] (@[śivasūtrāṇi]), or the sūtras revealed by @[śiva]. Each section ends with an indicatory letter called @deva[इत्] (@[it]) which is not to be counted among the letters of the alphabet. These "Its" serve an important purpose in Sanskrit grammar, as they enable the grammarians to express several letters, or groups of letters, in a very convenient and condensed form. For any letter, with the following @deva[इत्] added to it, is not only expressive of itself but of all letters that intervene between it and this @deva[इत्]; e.g. @deva[अण्] means @deva[अ], @deva[इ], @deva[उ], @deva[इक्] means @deva[इ], @deva[उ], @deva[ऋ], @deva[ऌ], &c. Similarly @deva[अच्] means technically the whole alphabet, @deva[अम्] any vowel, and @deva[हल्] any consonant; @deva[यण्] a semivowel, @deva[हश्] a soft consonant, @deva[खर्] a hard consonant, @deva[जश्] a soft unaspirate, @deva[झष्] a soft aspirate &c. Each of these significant terms is technically called a @deva[प्रत्याहार] (@[pratyāhāra]).

  Since short vowels include the long and the protracted vowels (See @ref[3]. a.) another @deva[इत्] '@deva[ट्]' is generally employed to mark a particular vowel: e.g. @deva[अ] means @deva[अ], @deva[आ] and @deva[आ३], but @deva[अट्] means @deva[अ] (of six kinds) only; so @deva[कृट्] means @deva[कृ] and nothing else.
