The declension of adjectives does not, in general, differ from that of substantives. It will not, therefore, be given here separately; the points of difference only will be noted.

## SECTION I.

## 1. BASES ENDING IN VOWELS.

**Note:**—The variations and modifications, which the general terminations given above undergo when applied to several of the vowel bases are so numerous, that it has been thought advisable not to notice them here, as being tedious, but simply to give the forms and leave the students to find them out for themselves. Every word declined here should be considered a model and words alike in form should be declined similarly to it.

## Nouns ending in @deva[अ] Mas. and Neu.
