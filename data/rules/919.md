Besides the general sense given above the Present tense from the context has the following senses:—

(a) [^1] It is sometimes used in the sense of 'immediate futurity,' @deva[कदा गमिष्यामि] when wilt thou go? @deva[एव गच्छामि] Here I go (i. e. shall go); @deva[ऊर्ध्वं क्षणोत्तरस्य म्रिये] I shall die an hour after.

(b) It may also be used to denote an action which is recently completed; @deva[कदा त्वं नगरादागतः]—@deva[इदानीमागच्छामि] when didst thou come from the city? Here I come (have come just now).

(c) In narrations it is used for the Past tense; @deva[गृध्रो ब्रवीति कस्त्वम्] the vulture says, 'who art thou'?

(d) Sometimes it is used to denote a habitual or repeated action; @deva[यदन्नेन जीवति].

[^1]: Pāṇ. III. 3. 131. See p. 525.
