Panini defines a 'Karmadhāraya' as @deva[समानाधिकरण तत्पुरुषः] or Tatpurusha both the members of which are in the same case relation i. e. have the same case when dissolved.

**N. B.** The difference between the Tatpurusha proper and Karmadhāraya is this:-In the case of the former the attributive member has one of the oblique cases when dissolved, while in the case of the latter it is in apposition to the other member. It may thus be a noun or an adjective qualifying the other member.
