## Nouns as Gati with Chvi-Derivatives

Several nouns, substantive and adjective, may be prefixed to the roots @deva[कृ], @deva[भू], and @deva[अस्] to form what are called in Sanskrit 'chvi-derivatives' (vide chap. IX. Sec. III.). @deva[कृष्णीकरण] = @deva[कृष्णीकरण]; @deva[धनीभूत] = @deva[धनीभूत]. Such nouns are also termed 'Gati.'
