In Sanskrit simple words, whether substantives, adjectives, verbs or indeclinables, have the power of entering into combination with one another and forming what are called 'Samāsas', compound words or, in short, compounds.

**(a)** A compound thus formed may further be compounded with another simple or compound word, and this again may become the member of a new compound.
