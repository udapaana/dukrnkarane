[^1] The Conditional is used in those conditional sentences in which the Potential may be used when the nonperformance of the action is implied or in which the falsity of the antecedent is involved as a matter of fact. It expresses both future and past time. It must be used in both the antecedent and the consequent clauses; @deva[यद्यवर्षिष्यद् अवर्षिष्यन्नन्नस्य बाहुल्यमभविष्यत्] if ever if there would be plentiful rain there would be an abundance of corn; @deva[यदि तदपिनिर्भत्स्यदलाभ्यच्यतत्पुष्पाणां तव रतिरभविष्यदहो किमस्यनु] hadst thou obtained (which thou hast not) the sweet fragrance of her breath, wouldst thou have had any liking for this lotus?
