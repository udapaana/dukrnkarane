In addition to the characters given above there are in Sanskrit two nasal sounds:—the one called @deva[अनुस्वार] (@[anusvāra]), is denoted by ं i.e. a dot placed above the letter after which it is to be pronounced, e.g. @deva[कं]; the other, called @deva[अनुनासिक] (@[anunāsika]) is denoted by ँ i.e. a dot within a semi-circle placed above the letter after which it is to be pronounced e.g. @deva[कँ].

And a sort of hard breathing is known as @deva[विसर्ग] (@[visarga]) (generally called @deva[विसर्जनीय] (@[visarjanīya]) by Sanskrit grammarians). It is denoted by the sign ः i.e. two vertical dots placed after the letter after which it is to be pronounced. In pronunciation it is a harder aspirate than @deva[ह]. The Visarga is not an original character but only a substitute for a final @deva[स्] @[s] or @deva[र्] @[r].

@deva[जिह्वामूलीय] (@[jihvāmūlīya]) and @deva[उपध्मानीय] (@[upadhmānīya]) are terms given to a sort of semi-visarga, when pronounced before @deva[क], @deva[ख], and @deva[प], @deva[फ] respectively. It is written symbolically as ᳵ and ᳶ. These may be regarded as the spirants of @deva[कवर्ग] and @deva[पवर्ग] respectively.
