## Passive Construction with Causative Verbs

When the causal forms are used in the passive, the principal object (i.e. the primitive subject) is put in the Nominative case; but in the case of roots implying 'knowledge or eating' and roots having a literary work for their object, the principal object is put in the Nominative case and the secondary object in the Accusative or vice versa; @deva[देवदत्तेन करोति] Devadatta prepares a mat—@deva[देवदत्तं देवदत्तेन वा कटं कारयति]; @deva[देवदत्तः कटं कार्यते] he makes Devadatta prepare a mat, @deva[देवदत्तः ग्रामं गच्छति] Dev. goes to a village; @deva[देवदत्तं ग्रामं गच्छयति] causes Dev. to go; @deva[देवदत्तः गच्छयते] Devadatta is made to go to a village, &c.; @deva[मणवकं धर्मं बोधयति] he makes Māṇavaka know his duty; @deva[बोध्यते मणवकं धर्मः मणवको धर्मं बोध्यते वा] Māṇavaka is made to know, &c.; @deva[वट्योदनं भोजयते] he makes the child eat food; @deva[वट्योदनं भोज्यते] or @deva[वट्योदनो भोज्यते] the boy is made, &c.
