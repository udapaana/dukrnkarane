## Adjective Agreement in Vocative Case and Adverbial Use

When an adjective qualifies a vocative noun, it takes the case of the antecedent noun; or it agrees with its noun in the vocative case. @deva[त्वयाऽस्य भोऽग्रज] (@deva[त्वयो भोऽग्रज]) O you that are eldest brother, &c.

When it qualifies a noun used as a vocative but not in the vocative case, the adjective is put in the vocative; @deva[हे तृष्णिन्] O thou greedy one, O thou thirsty one, @deva[हे कृष्ण] O thou black one, &c.

(a) The same applies to other kinds of addresses without @deva[हे]:—@deva[भो दृढिन्] O you stubborn man, @deva[भो वत्स] O my dear son.

(b) When adjectives are used adverbially with verbs, they are put in the neuter gender in the accusative singular; @deva[शीघ्रं तिष्ठति] he stands swiftly, @deva[नीचं निपत्यते] he falls down, @deva[दूरं गच्छति] he goes far. @deva[अस्य सर्वं समाप्तम्] all this is finished, &c. So also such expressions as @deva[क्षणं जीवति] he lives for a moment, @deva[मुहुर्तं तिष्ठति] he stays for a moment, &c.
