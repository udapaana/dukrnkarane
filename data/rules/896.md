The past passive participle is very frequently used to supply the place of a verb, sometimes in conjunction with the auxiliary verbs @deva[अस्] and @deva[भू]. The past passive participle agrees adjectivally with its gender, number and case, the agent being put in the Instrumental, while the past active participle is treated exactly like the verb in the past tense; @deva[तेन कार्यं कृतम्] by him the work was done; @deva[तेन बन्धनानि छिन्नानि] by him the bonds were cut; @deva[आदिष्टोस्मि देव्या दूतिकया] I am commanded by queen Dūtikā; @deva[तेन कृतं कार्यम्] he did the work; @deva[राम हत्वा राक्षसान्] Rāma killed the Rākshasas; @deva[क्षत्तोसीमां नावमानीः] thou didst never despise me, &c.
