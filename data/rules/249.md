**Obs.**—The Bah. compounds are also further divided into two kinds; @deva[तद्गुणसंविज्ञानबहुव्रीहिः] and @deva[अतद्गुणसंविज्ञानबहुव्रीहिः]. That in which the sense of the attributive member is also present is called Tadguṇasaṃvijñāna. @deva[पीताम्बरं हरिमाहुय] is an instance of the first; here such a @deva[हरि] is meant as has the yellow silk garment actually on. @deva[चित्रगुं गोपं आनय] is of the other; here what is meant is herdsman only and not his variegated cows.
