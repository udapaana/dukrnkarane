## Prefixing इ to Benedictive Terminations

### (a) Seṭ and Veṭ Roots

@deva[इ] is prefixed to the terminations after Seṭ roots and optionally after Veṭ ones.

### (b) Roots Ending in ऋ

Roots ending in @deva[ऋ] preceded by a conjunct consonant, the root @deva[ऋ] and roots ending in @deva[ऋ] admit of @deva[इ] optionally.
