The infinitive cannot be used as the subject or object of a verb, abstract nouns supplying its place in this case. Where, therefore, the infinitive occurs in English as the subject or the object in a sentence, the abstract noun derived from the root must be used in Sanskrit; @deva[स्वधर्माचरणं हितवत्] to do one's duty is beneficial and not @deva[स्वधर्ममाचरितुम्].
