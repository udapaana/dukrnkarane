When @deva[जातु] or @deva[आत्] is used in a sentence and condemns or censures or implies that the Present may be used in the sense of the three tenses; @deva[आपि जानाति स्मापि जाने भणिकत्वमाप्नोसि] where @deva[स्मापि] and @deva[आप्नोसि] may have also the sense of the Past or the Future tense; @deva[जातु तवभवान् यज्ञपयिष्यति शूद्रम्] (you will even make a S'ūdra perform a sacrifice).
