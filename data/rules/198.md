The following rules should be observed in arranging the various members of a Dwandwa Compound:—

**(a)**[^1] A word ending in @deva[ऋ] or @deva[उ] should be placed first, and when there are more than one of such words one of these should be placed first, the rest being arranged according to the will of the speaker or writer; @deva[हरिहरौ], @deva[हरिहरश्वराः]; @deva[हरियहराः], &c.

**(b)**[^2] Words beginning with a vowel and ending in @deva[अ] ought to precede others; as @deva[अश्वरथयोः] or @deva[इन्द्राग्न्योः]. This rule should have preference even over the above rule in case both would be simultaneously applicable; @deva[इन्द्राग्नी].

**(c)**[^3] A word that has fewer syllables should be placed first and in case there are more words than one having an equal number of syllables, the one that has more short syllables should be placed first; e. g. @deva[चिरक्षमावो], @deva[ग्रीष्मवसन्तौ], @deva[कुशाकरवः], &c.; the names of seasons and stars, under this latter circumstance, should be arranged according to their astronomical order; as @deva[इन्द्रविशाखरवसन्ताः], @deva[शततभरोहिणी], &c. Also a word of more important significance should precede others; as @deva[तापसपर्वतौ].

**(d)**[^4] Names of the four castes of men should be arranged according to their order, beginning from the highest and so should be the names of brothers beginning from the eldest; e. g. @deva[ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियवैश्यशूद्राः]; @deva[युधिष्ठिरार्जुनौ].
