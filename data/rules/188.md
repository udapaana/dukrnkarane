Samāhāra Dwandwa is that species of Dwandwa which implies an aggregate of the things enumerated in which constitute a complex idea. It is always singular and neuter Thus @deva[आहारनिद्राभयम्] does not merely mean 'food, sleep and fear' but all that characterises animal life. In this species the meaning of the different members is subordinate to the collective sense of the whole compound.
