## Ablative for Distance in Time and Space

(a) The place or time from which the distance of another place or point of time is to be expressed is put in the Ablative case; the distance in space being put in the Nominative or the Locative and that in time in the Locative; @deva[वनात् ग्रामो योजनं योजने वा] (Sid. Kau.) the village is a yojana from the forest; @deva[नवग्रन्थात् सांकाश्यं द्वादशे योजनानि चतुर्षु योजनेषु वा] (Mb.).

(b) The Ablative is also used in 'portion and subtraction.'[^1]
