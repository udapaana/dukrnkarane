## Ablative with Learning and Origin

(a) The teacher from whom something is learnt regularly is put in the Ablative case; @deva[आचार्यात् अधीते] learns from the preceptor; but @deva[नटस्य गातां युनोति].

(b) Similarly the prime or original cause in the case of @deva[जन्] 'to be born,' and the source in the case of @deva[प्र+भू] are put in the Ablative; @deva[ब्रह्मणः जनः भजन्ते] the creation proceeds from Brahman; @deva[गोमयात् जायते] the devotion is born from cowdung; @deva[हिमवतः गङ्गा प्रभवति] the Gaṅgā rises from the Himālayas; @deva[असूयायात् भिन्नयते] from desire anger is produced.

Note:—Verbs meaning 'to be born' or 'to be begotten upon' are often used with the Loc.; @deva[तस्यां शतानन्दः अजायत] from her was born Śatānanda; @deva[नैनकायां आविजात] begotten upon Menakā, &c.; Manu Smr. IX. 1. 9.[^1]
