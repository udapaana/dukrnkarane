The infinitive in Sanskrit generally expresses the purpose or that for which an action is done and thus corresponds to the infinitive of purpose or gerund in English. The infinitive in Sanskrit thus involves the sense of the Dative and may, if desired, be replaced by the Dative of the verbal noun derived from the root; @deva[पानीयं पातुं यमुनातीरम् अवतीर्ण] descended from the bank of Yamunā to drink water; here @deva[पातुम्] may be replaced by @deva[पानाय] (@deva[पानस्य पानम्]); @deva[शाखामृगविनाशायोद्यतः] (Rag. X. 25.) where @deva[विनाशाय] =@deva[विनाशयितुम्].

"The infinitive (formed with @deva[तुम्] tum) in Sanskrit?" remarks Prof. Monier Williams, "cannot be employed with the same latitude as in other languages. Its use is very limited corresponding to that of the Latin supine, as its termination tum indicates."

(a) "Let the student, therefore, distinguish between the infinitive of Sanskrit and that of Latin and Greek. In these latter languages we have the infinitive made the subject of a proposition, or, in other words, standing in the place of a Nominative and an Accusative case often admissible before it. We have it also assuming different forms, to express present, past, or future time, and completeness or incompleteness in the progress of the action. The Sanskrit infinitive, on the other hand, can never be made the subject of a verb, admits of no Accusative before it, and can only express indefiniteness time and incomplete action. Wherever it occurs, it must be considered as the object, and never the subject of some verb expressed or understood. As the object of the verb, it may be regarded as equivalent to a verbal substantive, in which the force of two cases, an Accusative and Dative, is inherent and which differs from other substantives in its power of governing a case. Its use as a substantive, with the force of the Accusative case, corresponds to our use of the Latin infinitive; thus @deva[तव वचनं श्रोतुम् इच्छामि] is I desire to hear thou that, @deva[तत्तव श्रवणम्]; where @deva[श्रोतुम्] and audire are both equivalent to Accusative. Similarly, @deva[रोदितुमारेभे] 'she began to weep,' and @deva[महीं जेतुम् आरेभे], he began to conquer the earth, where @deva[महीजयम् आरेभे], he began the conquest of the earth, would be equally correct.''

(b) "Bopp considers the termination of the infinitive to be the Accusative of the suffix tu (@ref[453], Obs.), and it is certain that in the veda other cases of nouns formed with this suffix in the sense of the infinitive occur; e.g. a Dative in tave, havai, se from han comes hantave 'to kill;' fr, anu-i entease, 'to follow;' fr, man, mantavai, 'to think;' there is also a form in tos generally in the sense of an Ablative; e.g. fr. i, comes stos 'from going;' ir, han, hantos, 'from killing,' 'before killing;' and a form in tsi corresponding to the indeclinable participle in tvā of the classical languages; e.g. fr. han, hatsi 'killing,' fr. bhā bhātsi 'being,' &c &c," Sanskrit Grammar.
