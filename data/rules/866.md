## Locative/Genitive with आयुक्त and कुशल (appointed/devoted)

The words @deva[आयुक्त] and @deva[कुशल] meaning 'appointed or devoted to' are construed with the Locative or the Genitive @deva[आयुक्तः कुशलो वा हरिपूजने हरिपूजनस्य वा] appointed to worship Hari; @deva[कुशलोऽनेधुयुरुरेषात्युङ्गु दुर्धुकरणि] (Bhaṭṭi. VIII. 115.) In other senses they are construed with the Locative; @deva[आयुक्तो गोषु युगे] a bull harnessed to the yoke of a carriage; @deva[कर्मणि कुशलः] expert in the performance of an act.[^1]
