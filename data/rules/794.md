## Relative Pronoun Agreement with Antecedent

When a relative pronoun refers to an antecedent, it must agree with it in gender and number, not in case; @deva[यः पुरुषः स आगतः] that man has come (the relative and the demonstrative are here in the nominative); @deva[येन पुरुषेण स गतः] that man has gone (the relative is in the instr. while the demonstrative is in the nominative); @deva[यं पुरुषं तं पश्यामि] I see that man (the relative is in the accusative while the demonstrative is in the nominative).
