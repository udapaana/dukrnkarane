## Roots That Are Also Prātipadika (यङ् Derivatives)

There are several roots[^1] which are also Prātipadikas and which may be regarded as Nominal verbal bases derived from those Prātipadikas by means of the affix @deva[य] (@deva[यङ्]).

The more important of these are given below:

| Root | Form | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| @deva[दयुष्] | @deva[दयुषति-ते] | he scratches |
| @deva[सुशूष्] | @deva[सुशूष्यति] | he worships |
| @deva[मन्द] | @deva[मंदयति] | he offends against, he becomes angry |
| | @deva[मंदयते] | (according to Candra) |
| @deva[निवञ्ज] | @deva[निवञ्जयति] | treats medically |
| @deva[इषुध] | @deva[इषुध्यति] | it contains arrows |
| @deva[गद्द] | @deva[गद्दयति] | he stammers |
| @deva[क्ला] | @deva[क्लायति] | is delighted |
| @deva[कैल], @deva[सैल] | @deva[कैलायति], @deva[सैलायति] | he sports, he becomes merry |
| @deva[अङ्ग] | @deva[अङ्गयति-ते] (@deva[शुस्यति]) | he is jealous, he envies, etc. |
| @deva[कुप्णि] | @deva[कुप्णायति] | he is angry or feels ashamed |
