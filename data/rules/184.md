The expounding of a Samāsa (i. e. giving its Vigrahavākya) consists in the expression of the various relations existing between the objects or ideas denoted by the various members of a Samāsa by means of the proper cases or subordinate sentences.

**(a)** When the Vigrahavākya cannot be given, or cannot be given by using the words actually compounded, the compound is called nityasamāsa (@deva[अविग्रहो नित्यसमासः अरुपपदविग्रहो वा ।] Sid. Kau.).
