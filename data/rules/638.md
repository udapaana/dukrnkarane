## Semantic Distinction in Parasmaipada Frequentatives

As the Parasm. Freq. base is used both in the sense of frequency and of intensity, it has been said to denote the former in the strong cases and the latter in the weak.

### Examples

@deva[जोहूति], @deva[जोहवीति] 'to invoke frequently'

@deva[जुहुती] 'to invoke repeatedly'

It is, however, not easy to make such a distinction with regard to the other roots.
