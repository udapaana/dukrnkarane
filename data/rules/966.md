The most important of these conjunctions and the one very frequently used is @deva[च]. It can never stand first in a sentence, nor can it be used like 'and' in English. It is has a sentence, we can it be used like 'and' in English. It is has a with such as the words or assertions it connects or is placed after the last of the words or assertions it joins together, @deva[रामं लक्ष्मणम्] or @deva[रामः लक्ष्मणश्च कामानां यौवनानि गवेषणानां च] love with its excellences expanded, and fresh youth; @deva[कदलानि कन्यायु बध्यतो नवेन पुणैनः नैतीविराधायां च]।

(a) Sometimes this particle has a disjunctive force; @deva[ज्ञानतिदानभ्यां स्वर्गति च बाहुः]—the hermitage is tranquil yet my arm throbs.

(b) Rarely this particle is used in the sense of 'if'; @deva[जीवितं चैच्छसि यत् हेत्वं मे गहृः प्रणवं] oh fool, if you wish to live, &c.

(c) Sometimes it is used as an expletive; @deva[सोमानः पार्यस्यनैयुच]।

(d) Sometimes it is used to connect a subordinate fact with a main one @deva[निश्चत्य चाराणा] wander for alms and bring a corn; @deva[कुटिनानं च ज्यावितृर गोवृधे च नि संराघतेः करदराकम् परुष्कृतः] the procuress was chastised, the ox-wardess was expelled and Kardarakam was honoured.

(e) When the particle is repeated it has sometimes the sense of 'on the one hand,' 'on the other hand,' 'and yet,' @deva[क च हरिणशावानां जीवितानां छाततारण्योनै कं च विप्रमोत्पातं बलवज्रानां शरस्यनै] where, on the one hand, is the extremely frail life of fawns, and where, on the other, are thy arrows hard like adamant and falling sharply; @deva[न युदन्यैप सुको मानुन्नोनुयुदुदो च स्त्री र्विकोस्यानं युदुप्रीतिः कैश्चित्युयुर्थों न च] the one hand is full moon-faced wife is not easy to obtain and yet there is this unaccountable sport of love.

(f) Sometimes the repetition of @deva[च] shows the simultaneous or undivided occurrence of two events; @deva[मे च पायदरतानां प्रपुवन चादिवास्यतः] they reached the ocean and at the same time the primeval Being arose awoke.
