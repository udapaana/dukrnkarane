Vṛitti (@deva[वृत्ति]) is the general term for any complex formation in Sanskrit requiring explanation or resolution. These Vṛittis are five in number; viz. @deva[कृद्वृत्ति] or the formation of words from roots by primary affixes; @deva[तद्धितवृत्ति] or the formation of derivative bases from nouns by secondary affixes; @deva[धातुवृत्ति] or the formation of derivative verbs from primitive roots; @deva[समासवृत्ति] or the formation of a compound word by the composition of several words; and @deva[एकशेषवृत्ति] or the composition of words in which one of several nouns generally alike in form is retained. The first three will be treated in their proper places. We will treat of the last two in this Chapter.
