By Sandhi (from @deva[सम्] together, and @deva[धा] to join) is meant the coalescence of two letters coming in immediate contact with each other.[^1]

@deva[संहिता] (@[Saṃhitā])[^2] or sandhi is necessary in the case of the internal structure of a @deva[पद] (@[pada]), prepositions and roots joined together and a compound word (@deva[समास] @[samāsa]), while in that of a sentence i.e. in the case of the finals and initials of the different words in a sentence, it depends on the will of the writer.

**I. SVARASANDHI, OR THE COMBINATION OF FINAL AND INITIAL VOWELS.**

[^1]: @deva[परः सन्निकर्षः संहिता] — Pāṇ. I. 4. 109. Saṃhitā is the extreme contiguity of letters.

[^2]: @deva[संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः। नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते॥] — Sid. Kau. This couplet gives the rule for the observation of Sandhi.
