Names of directions may form a Bahuvrīhi compound and signify the point of direction between them;[^1] @deva[दक्षि-णस्याः पूर्वस्याश्च दिशोऽन्तरालं दक्षिणपूर्वा]; so @deva[उत्तरपूर्वा], &c. But if the words so compounded are not the names of quarters, no compound is possible; as @deva[ऐन्द्याश्च कौबेर्याश्चान्तरालं विन्दु] the point between the East and the North, and not @deva[ऐन्द्रकौबेरी] as these are not the names of the Eastern and Northern quarters.
