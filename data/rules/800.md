## Verbs of Motion Govern Accusative of Destination

Roots having the sense of motion, real or metaphorical govern the Accusative of the place to which it is directed. @deva[ग्रामं गच्छति] goes to a village; @deva[अजविचरितं विचरति दावं] with his bow strung he roamed all over the forest; @deva[आनन्दस्य परां काष्ठां गच्छत] they reached the highest point of joy; @deva[मनसा कृष्णं] goes to Kṛṣṇa (thinks of him) mentally; @deva[अतः प्रभृति चिन्तयन् निद्रां याति] while thus pondering he sank into sleep.

(a) When the motion is real, the Dative may also be used; @deva[मातुले ग्रामं वा गच्छति]; but not of words denoting 'a road;' @deva[पन्थानं गच्छति] only; but @deva[उपमार्गं याति गच्छति] he reaches the main road by taking a by-path.

[^1]: But when the relation of object and verb is expressed by the passive termination the noun forming the object is put in the nominative case; @deva[हरिः सेव्यते].
