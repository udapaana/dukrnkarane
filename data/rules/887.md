Adjectives in the Comparative degree are used with the Ablative; @deva[वर्धनात्तरणं श्रेयः] protection (of one's subjects) is better than aggrandizement. @deva[अर्जुनाद्वयसा ज्येष्ठो युधिष्ठिरः] Yudhishthira was older than Arjuna.

(:) Sometimes the comparative is used with the Instrumental; @deva[प्राणैर्दयिरः] dearer than life. See also @ref[863] Note.
