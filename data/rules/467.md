The roots @deva[सिच्] 2 Â. 'to shine' and @deva[चेङ्] 2 Â. 'to go' do not take Guṇa or Vṛddhi before any termination. They also drop their final vowel before the intermediate @deva[इ] and @deva[य]. @deva[दरिद्रा] also drops its @deva[आ] before a non-conjugational termination except in the Desiderative and the Aorist where it retains it optionally.
