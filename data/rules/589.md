## Formation of Passive Voice

Every root in every one of the ten conjugational classes may take a Passive form conjugated like an Ātmanepadi root of the 4th Class.[^1]

[^1]: The only difference is in the accent; in the Passive it falls on @deva[य], whereas in the case of the primitive verbs of the 4th class, Ātm., it falls on the radical syllable.
