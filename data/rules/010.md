A @deva[स्वर] (@[svara]) or vowel is that which can be pronounced without the help of any other letter; a @deva[व्यञ्जन] (@[vyañjana]) or consonant is that which is pronounced with the help of a vowel. The consonants, therefore, are written with a slanting nether stroke to denote their imperfect character.

Hence the consonants are given, in the system of Pāṇini, with an @deva[अ] added to them for the sake of pronunciation.

As already remarked, there are no separate names for the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, except the two mentioned before, viz. @deva[अनुस्वार] and @deva[विसर्ग], and @deva[रेफ] (@[Refa]) which is the name sometimes given to @deva[र]. The word @deva[कार] (@[kāra]) is therefore used as an affix to denote a particular letter; e.g. @deva[अकार] the letter '@deva[अ]', @deva[ककार] the letter '@deva[क]', &c.
