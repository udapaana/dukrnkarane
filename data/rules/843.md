## Ablative for Cause, Argument, Comparison

(a) The Ablative often denotes the cause of an action or condition and may be translated by 'on account of, by reason of,' &c.; @deva[मौनात् पंडितः गणयते] one is considered a fool by reason of his silence (if he keeps silence); @deva[गोमानुप्रयणः] (H.) on account of my killing cows and men.

(b) The Ablative is used to make a causative assertion or to advance an argument; @deva[धूमात् अग्निः] The mountain is fiery (has fire on it); because there is smoke.

(c) The Ablative is used with comparatives or words having a comparative sense; @deva[भक्तेर्मार्गात् ज्ञानमार्गः श्रेयः] the way of knowledge is more efficient than that of devotion; @deva[अणुतरातुयुच्युचरु] smaller than an atom; @deva[सत्यात् उत्तरिच्यनं] truth alone is superior to a thousand horse-sacrifices.[^1]
