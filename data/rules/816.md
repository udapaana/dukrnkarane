## Instrumental for Cause, Motive, and Purpose

The Instrumental is also used to express the cause or motive or the object of purpose of an action as distinguished from the mere instrument of it; @deva[पुण्येन दृष्टो हरिः] Hari was seen by (virtue of) merit; @deva[तेनाऽपराधेन दण्ड्योऽस्ति] thou art to be punished for that fault; @deva[अध्ययनेन वसति] dwells for the purpose of studying; also when the object to be accomplished is simply implied; @deva[अलं अनेन] away with your efforts i.e. they will not succeed; @deva[श्रमेण सार्थं नास्ति] (Sid. Kau).[^1]
