The sense of the reflexive pronoun is, in Sanskrit, expressed by the word @deva[आत्मन्] 'self' which is invariably used in the masculine gender and singular number, and by the reflexive adverb @deva[स्वयम्] e.g. @deva[गुप्तं ददृशुरात्मानं सर्वाः स्वप्नेषु वामनैः] "they all (the wives of Das'aratha) saw in dreams that they were guarded by dwarfs; " @deva[सः] or @deva[सा कृतापराधमिव आत्मानमवगच्छति ।] @deva[राजा स्वयं समरभूमि जगाम], &c.
