The Potential Participle is formed by means of the affixes @deva[तव्य], @deva[अनीय], @deva[य] and rarely @deva[एलिम्], added to a root or derivative verb. This is Passive when the verb is transitive and impersonal when the verb is intransitive. It is also used like an adjective when denoting fitness, &c.
