## Formation of Periphrastic Perfect

The Periphrastic Perfect is formed by adding @deva[आम्] to the root and then adding the forms of the reduplicated Perfect of @deva[कृ], @deva[भू], or @deva[अस्] as terminations; when the forms of @deva[कृ], are added, a Parasmaipadi root takes the Parasmaipadi forms and an Ātmanepadi one takes the Ātmanepadi forms.
