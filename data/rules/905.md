The Potential passive participle is used in the sense of 'what should or ought to be done;' besides this, this participle yields the sense of 'fitness, obligation, necessity, capacity,' &c., the agent being put in the Instrumental case; @deva[विचिन्त्य मनसा किं कर्तव्यं कर्तव्यम्] (Devi Bhāg. IV. 7. 1.) he considered in his mind what he ought to do; @deva[धर्मः अनुष्ठेयः] religious duty ought to be followed; @deva[त्वया भारो बहुभिदः] thou art able to bear this burden; @deva[इमं दुष्टं वध्यः] this rogue deserves to be killed; @deva[गन्तव्या ते यक्षनाथानां अलका नाम यद्वसतिः] thou will have to go to Alakā, the habitation of the lords of Yakṣhas, &c.

Obs.—Sometimes the agent is put in the Genitive case; @deva[मया सेव्यो हरिः] Hari is to be served by me; @deva[विद्वद्भिः भक्ष्यम् अन्नम्] boiled rice to be eaten by Brāhmaṇas.
