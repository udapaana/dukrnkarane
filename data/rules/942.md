When the idea of wonder is to be expressed and the words @deva[नु], @deva[हि] and @deva[अपि] do not occur in a sentence, the Simple Future should be used; @deva[प्रभुन्दोऽन्दोऽपि हरिं पश्यति हरिं पश्यिष्यति] it is a wonder that a blind man sees Hari.

(a) The Simple Future is also used when the particles @deva[नु] and @deva[आपि] expressing a doubt are used; @deva[नु दण्डः पतिष्यति] will the stick fall? @deva[आपि कपाटं पिदधासिष्यति द्वारम्] will be close the door?

(b) This Future is also used when the particle @deva[अर्ह्] meaning sure or able is used; @deva[अहर्हं हत्वा निश्चयम्] Kṛishṇa is sure sure or able to kill the elephant.
