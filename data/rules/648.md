## Formation with काम्य Affix

To express the sense of wishing for that which is denoted by the noun, the affix @deva[काम्य] is also added like the above and the base so derived conjugated in the Parasmaipada as before.

### Examples

@deva[पुत्रकाम्यति] 'he wishes for a son'

@deva[यशस्काम्यति] 'he wishes for fame'

@deva[लाभकाम्यति] 'he wishes for ghee'
