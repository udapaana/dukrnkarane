**(a)** As a general rule the @deva[स्] of the nom. singular is dropped. If there be a conjunct consonant at the end of a word the first consonant only is retained.

**(b)** The final letter is changed to the first or third of its class when followed by nothing, to the third when followed by a soft consonant and first when followed by a hard consonant and remains unchanged before a vowel termination.

**(c)** @deva[न्] is prefixed to the @deva[इ] of the N. & Acc. plural in the case of neuter nouns ending in a consonant except a nasal or a semi-vowel; but not in the case of a noun derived from the frequentative base.
