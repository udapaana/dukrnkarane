The @deva[स्] of the Nominative Singular masculine of the pronouns @deva[एषः], @deva[सः], and the like is dropped if the preceding word ends in any vowel except @deva[अ] or @deva[आ];[^1] e.g. @deva[हरिः] + @deva[एषः] = @deva[हरि एषः] this is Hari; @deva[विष्णुः] + @deva[सः] = @deva[विष्णु सः] that is Viṣṇu; @deva[अनयोः] + @deva[एषः] = @deva[अनयो एषः] this is of the two; but @deva[हरिर्एषः], @deva[विष्णुर्एषः] are equally correct; but @deva[कृष्णः] + @deva[एषः] = @deva[कृष्णोऽयम्] or @deva[कृष्ण एषः] or @deva[कृष्णरेषः] this is Kṛṣṇa. Here @deva[स्] is dropped on the authority of this aphorism, and if it be not dropped, then it is either changed into @deva[र्] or else it may remain, and @deva[अः] be dropped (Pāṇ. VIII. 3. 19, VIII. 3. 15, VI. 1. 133).

**Note.** Thus ends the chapter on Sandhi, a thorough knowledge of which is necessary before one can begin the study of the language.
