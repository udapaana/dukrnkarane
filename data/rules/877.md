## Introduction to Genitive and Locative Absolute Constructions

## THE GENITIVE AND THE LOCATIVE ABSOLUTES

"When the participle agrees with a subject different from the subject of the verb, the phrase is said to be in the absolute construction." Bain.

In English, the Nominative is used as an Absolute case; in Sanskrit the Genitive and the Locative are so used. The English-Nominative Absolute ought, therefore, to be translated by the Sanskrit Locative Absolute. When the Absolute Construction is to be used, the subject of the participle must be put in the Genitive or the Locative case and the participle made to agree with it in gender, number and case.

N. B. When the subject or object of the principal sentence is the same as that of the participial phrase, the absolute construction should not be used; as @deva[अयोध्यायाः निवृत्तः राज्यं राज्याम् अकरोत्] and not @deva[अयोध्यायां निवृत्तं राज्यै युङ्] &c.; @deva[आगतः निषसाद दुक्तानुसारच्चात्] and not @deva[आगतस्यं निषसाद तेष्युः] &c.
