## Periphrastic Perfect Formation

The Periphrastic Perfect is formed of all roots beginning with any vowel except @deva[अ] or @deva[आ] which is naturally or prosodially long, and of roots of more than one syllable (roots of the 10th class and other derivative roots included). Exceptions:—@deva[ऊड्] and @deva[चक्ष्] which take the Reduplicative Perfects.
