## Meaning of Desiderative Forms

The Desiderative expresses the notion that a person or thing wishes (or is about) to perform the action, or to be in the condition denoted by the root or the desiderative base.

**Examples:**
- @deva[पिपठिषति] 'he wishes to study' from @deva[पठ्]
- @deva[मुमूर्षति] 'he is about to die' from @deva[मृ], &c.
