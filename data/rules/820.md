## Dative with रुच् and Roots of Pleasing

The roots @deva[रुच्] and others having the same sense govern the Dative of the person or thing pleased or satisfied; @deva[हरै रोचते कृष्णः] Kṛṣṇa likes devotion; @deva[अस्मै न स्पृहः न सतिस्पृहः स्यंगः गुणितः सदते तुषयरु] 'a stream of sweet water, cool and perfumed, is not liked by one who has already drunk enough of water.'[^1]
