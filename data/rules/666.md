## Unādi Affixes and Introduction to Participles

There is a peculiar class of Kṛt or Primary affixes technically designated by Sanskrit grammarians—Unādi or those beginning with the affix @deva[उण्], i.e. the affix @deva[उ] with the signs or indicatory letter @deva[न्].

### Characteristics of Unādi Affixes

These Unādi affixes form primary nouns, like other Kṛt affixes form verbal roots, but are classed separately because:

1. Their application is limited
2. The nouns derived by their means are either formed irregularly
3. The connection between their senses and the meanings of roots from which they are supposed to be derived is not so clearly discernible as in the case of other primary derivatives

### Examples

@deva[अश्व] 'a horse' which is derived either from:
- @deva[आस्] 'to pervade', or
- @deva[अश्व] 'road'

@deva[काड्] 'an artisan' from @deva[कृ] 'to do', etc.
