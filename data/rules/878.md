## Locative Absolute: Simultaneous or Indicative Actions

When the action done or suffered by a person or thing indicates another action i. e. when the time of the happening of the one action which is known indicates that of the second action, the Locative Absolute be used; @deva[गोषु दुह्यमानासु गतः] he went away while the cows were being milked; @deva[अवसिते रात्रौ] the night being ended; @deva[कुतः धर्मक्षेत्रविघ्नः सति रक्षितरि त्वयि] whence can there be obstacles to our religious rites when thou art the protector of the good.[^1]
