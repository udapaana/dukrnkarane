## Omission of Correlative Pronoun in Dual/Plural

When the antecedent is of the dual or the plural number, the correlative pronoun in the principal clause may be omitted, and the verb put in that number of which the antecedent is; @deva[ये पुरुषाः तव सुताः वा वस्युर्कुटागच्छन्ति] or @deva[ये पुरुषाः तव सुताः ते गच्छन्ति] those men who are your sons go (in the first sentence the correlative pronoun @deva[ते] is omitted and the verb, though governed by an antecedent in the relative clause, is made plural).
