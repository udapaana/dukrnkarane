[^1] The Imperative Mood does not express merely command, but also entreaty, benediction, courteous enquiry, gentle advice, ability, &c.

(a) In the second person this Mood is used to express command, entreaty, gentle advice and benedictions or blessings; @deva[गच्छ] (@deva[त्वम्]) @deva[कुसुमपुरम्] go to Kusumapur; @deva[परित्रायस्व मां परित्राहि] help! help! reverently go to God; forgive; @deva[जीवतां] live; @deva[वर्धस्व] prosper; @deva[कुरु निर्देशमपि सकलोजसम्] (Śak. IV.) serve your elders and treat your co-wives as if they were your friends; @deva[पाणौ कृत्वाकुरुस्व मे गत्वा यात् राघवं] be thou my messenger, go to Rāghava, and say to him; @deva[अनन्यादिया प्रतिमुक्तोति साक्षात् तामन्त्रितवते दिशा] she was addressed the truth by Fate when he said 'do thou obtain a husband not devoted to any other lady.'

(b) In the third person it is often used to express a blessing and sometimes gentle command; @deva[विपाणां लब्ध गोः...मञ्जुः पापान् हरिचरणवरण्योपैतु] may this handful of flowers scattered on the feet of Hari give us success; @deva[वर्षन्तु कालान् वसुन्] may rain pour down; @deva[विद्या भारतिनां स्तनोद् लुक्षतस्य] (Mud. III. 1st).

(c) In the first person it expresses a question, necessity, ability, &c, @deva[किं करवाणि तात मे पित् व्याकरणम्] what shall I tell you? @deva[प्रामणि] I would die; @deva[स्यातै परायणामि युति निर्णयं तव] we will (are able to) do this thing, oh queen, which is agreeable to you; @deva[मा ह्यदैष्टं पुरे स्यास्यस्य तत् तीतः] (Bhattṛi XX. 6.) let your thought be 'I must not commit the horrible murder of an ambassador.'
