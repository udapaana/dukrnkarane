## Special rules of Sandhi of the finals of roots and the initial letters of terminations:—

**(1)** The ending @deva[आ] of a root takes its Vṛddhi substitute when followed by a consonantal strong termination; as @deva[आ+ति=आति].

**(2)** The final @deva[इ] or @deva[उ], short or long, of a root is changed to @deva[इय्] or @deva[उव्] before a vowel weak termination.

**(3)** The ending @deva[ह्] of roots is changed to @deva[ढ] when followed by any consonant, except a nasal or a semivowel, or by nothing; and that of roots beginning with @deva[द्] to @deva[त्] under the same circumstances.

**(4)** The initial @deva[त] or @deva[थ] of a termination is changed to @deva[च] after a soft aspirate (4th letter of a class).

**(5)** @deva[द्] or @deva[ध्] followed by @deva[स] is changed to @deva[त्].

**(6)** @deva[द्] and @deva[ध्] when followed by a consonant are changed to the nasal of the class to which the following consonant belongs, and to an anusvāra when followed by @deva[श्], @deva[ष्], @deva[स] or @deva[ह].

**(7)** The ending @deva[इ] of a root, short or long, not preceded by a conjunct consonant is changed to @deva[य] before vowel weak terminations, when the base consists of more than one syllable.

**(8)** The ending @deva[इ] of a root is optionally changed to @deva[र्] or Visarga in the Imperfect second pers. sing. and the ending @deva[द्] to @deva[त्] or @deva[ढ्] before the termination @deva[स्] and optionally before @deva[थ्].

**(9)** When a conjunct consonant having @deva[श्] or @deva[ष्] for its first member is at the end of a word or is followed by a consonant except a nasal or a semivowel, the @deva[श्] or @deva[ष] is dropped.

**N. B.**—The usual Sandhi rules i. e. those given in the 2nd and 3rd Chapters should be observed.
