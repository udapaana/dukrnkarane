## The Particles @deva[अथ] and @deva[इति].

The @deva[यदि] and @deva[चेत्] 'if' are usually used with the Potential or the Conditional; as @deva[यदि सोऽत्र संलहितो गौर्वं तर्हिनां ननु सहायम् कुर्यात्मसि] if he were here he would assist me; @deva[यदि दैवदत्तोऽत्र विवरुरनभविष्यदकर्यदेच्] had Devadatta been here, he would have undoubtedly done this; but they are also construed with the Present Indicative; @deva[यदि देवदत्त प्राहर्षि प्रयारानम्] if he lives till to-morrow; @deva[याजयिष्यामि]; @deva[यदि परा देवार्थायुनै युयोकायुरुनौनि] if Your Majesty has any thing to do with me, &c; @deva[क्षोत्यसि मुन जीवितेन यदि बाष्पं न कश्चरोयु] I conjure you by my life if you will not tell this in words. @deva[चेत्] is rarely used at the beginning of a sentence, &c.; @deva[चेत्सुत्युयुदुनुन्युन्यु प्रारं नयुविरधासत्] (S'ak. VII. 4) if the thousand-rayed one (sun) did not place him at the yoke of his car, @deva[आदि रौदैराकुरोतोयु] (have recourse to) @deva[नो चेत्] &c Dha. V. I. 44.
