[^1] @deva[अथ] is used in the following senses:—(1) as a sign of auspiciousness [^2]; @deva[अथातो ब्रह्मजिज्ञासा] now begins the inquiry about Brahma; cf. the Bhāṣya on this sūtra (2) marks the beginning or commencement of a work; @deva[आरभत अथ ऋग्वेदस्याध्यायः] now is begun the Ist Tantra; so @deva[अथ गीतार्थप्रारम्भः], &c; (3) 'then' after that,' &c; @deva[अथ यत्रजापानै], &c. (Meg. II. 1.) After that i. e passing of the night) the lord of the earth, &c. (4) asks a question; @deva[अथ कुमार शकयार्थयुतनुदुयुनुयुयुनं] oh the venerable Kaśyapa all right that he may oblige the world? @deva[अथ कथमोयु युोयुदैयुनुयुं] are you able to eat? (5) 'and, including'; @deva[भोतुयू: अथ अजुर्युनुयुः] Bhīma and also Arjuna; (6) 'if;' @deva[अथ युययुयुच्युरुयुनैन जन्तोयुः] if death is sure to befall a creature, &c.

[^2]: Properly speaking this is not the sense of @deva[अथ]. The mere utterance or hearing of this word if considered as auspicious as the word is supposed to have emanated from the throat of Brahmā
