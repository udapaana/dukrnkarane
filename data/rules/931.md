[^1] The Aorist ought to be used when the idea of the continuousness or nearness of an action is to be implied; @deva[यावज्जीवमन्नमददात्] (Sid. Kau.) gave food throughout his life; @deva[तेनाश्व पौर्णमास्यां काल्यां अग्निमाधत्तान् आजुहावात् च सोमेन] (Sid. Kāu.) he consecrated the fire on the last Paurṇimā (i.e. full-moon day) and offered Soma, &c.

[^1]: Pāṇ. III. 3. 135. See next Page.
