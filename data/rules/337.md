# Chapter IX. Secondary Nominal Bases Derived by the Addition of the Taddhita or Secondary Affixes

The terminations used to form derivative bases, in Sanskrit are distinguished into two classes; (1) Kṛit (@deva[कृत्]) or Primary Affixes and (2) Taddhita (@deva[तद्धित]) or Secondary affixes. Kṛit are those affixes that are added to verbs, and the Nominal Bases formed by their means are called PRIMARY NOMINAL BASES; while TADDHITA affixes are those that are added to substantives, primary or derived from roots, and the bases formed with them are called SECONDARY NOMINAL BASES (vide @ref[179]).
