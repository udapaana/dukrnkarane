As sandhi is of primary importance in Sanskrit, @deva[विराम] (@[virāma]) or pause can be indicated only at the end of a sentence. The signs of punctuation, therefore, are only two, । and ॥. The former is used to mark the close of a sentence or the first half of a śloka or poetical stanza; the latter is employed to denote the close of a śloka.

The sign called @deva[अवग्रह] (@[Avagraha]) (and which represents half @deva[अ] @deva[अर्धकार] @[Ardhakāra]) is generally employed to mark the elision of short @deva[अ] after @deva[ए] or @deva[ओ]; e.g. @deva[तेऽपि] (@deva[ते] + @deva[अपि]), @deva[कालोऽस्मि] (@deva[कालो] + @deva[अस्मि]). The double mark ऽऽ is sometimes used to indicate the elision of @deva[आ] after initial long @deva[आ]; @deva[तथा] + @deva[आस्ते] = @deva[तथाऽऽस्ते].

The mark • is sometimes used to show that something is omitted, and which is to be understood from the context; e.g. अ• may stand for @deva[अच्छिन्न], •आर्याः for @deva[कविवराः आर्याः], &c.
