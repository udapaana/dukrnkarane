## Formation of Causal Base Like Tenth Class

The Causal Base of a root is formed like that of a root of the Tenth class. In the case of roots of the Tenth class the causal form is identical with the primitive. The Causal form takes either pada.

**Examples:**
- @deva[बुध्]—causal base @deva[बोधय], @deva[बोधयति] 'he causes to know'
- @deva[क्षुभ्]—@deva[क्षोभयति] 'he shakes or agitates'
- @deva[गण]—@deva[गणयति] 'he causes to count'
- @deva[नी]—@deva[नाययति] 'he makes another lead or to carry'
- @deva[कृ] 'to call' or 'to scatter'—@deva[करयति] 'he causes to do or scatter'
- @deva[कूद्]—@deva[कूदयति], &c.
