The difference between the Two Futures is the same as that between the Imperfect and the Aorist, the only difference being that the former refers to a future time and the latter to a past one. The First or Periphrastic expresses futurity definitely but not of this day; the Second or Simple Future expresses futurity indefinitely as also that of to-day; it is also employed to denote recent and future contiguous time; as @deva[अद्य वानरेन्द्र त्वं यास्यसि तदयोध्यां भरतपालिताम्] (Bhattṛi XXII,) oh monkey, to-morrow you will go to Ayodhyā governed by Bharata; @deva[आत्मजौ त्वां दृष्ट्वा च इष्यं प्रहर्षिष्यन्ति। श्रोष्यतः सहं मायाश्च होष्यामि प्रापणिष्यतः सह राघवस्य] (Bhattṛi XXII. 14.) they will be delighted on seeing you and will ask you questions about the welfare of us two and Sītā; and Bharata also will be greatly pleased; @deva[एते...उच्छेत्स्यन्ते कपिकेतनेन] (Kir. III. 22) they will be extirpated by the monkey-bannered one (Arjuna); @deva[सत्याद्य पुञ्जशालाः] S'ak. IV.) Śakuntala will go (goes) to-day; @deva[प्रविष्यति जिज्ञासे नु हत्वाप्यन्यं शमम्] (Bhattṛi XVI. 13) if my sons are killed I will die or kill the enemy, &c.
