## Instrumental with Time/Space for Accomplishment

When the accomplishment of an object is to be expressed, the Instrumental of words expressing the length of time or space is used; @deva[अहुना कोषेण भङ्ग्यादितीर्णः] the section (of the Veda) was studied by him in a day, or a Koṣa (i.e. by going over it); but @deva[वरधर्मेण नायते] as the accomplishment does not take place.
