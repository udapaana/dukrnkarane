The past indeclinable participle in Sanskrit denotes the prior of two actions done by the same agent and corresponds to the perfect participle in English; @deva[एवं उक्त्वा विरराम] having said this he stopped; @deva[तान् पृष्ठे समारोप्य सरसं नीत्वा प्रभक्षति] having seated them on his back, he carried them to the lake and ate them up.

As the past indeclinable participles or gerunds serve the purpose of carrying on the action of the verb and act as connecting links between sentences, they account for the sparing use made in Sanskrit composition of relative pronouns, conjunctions and connecting particles. When several powers are used the gerund should be translated by verbal tenses and copulative conjunctions; @deva[अथ संध्याकाले प्राप्ते चन्द्रापीडः पदातिः राजगृहं गत्वा पितुः समक्षम् दण्डमात्रं स्थित्वा इड्यं च विलासवतीं दृष्ट्वा आगत्य प्रमदावतीं प्रणिपत्य विसृष्टः] when the evening time approached, Chandāpīḍa went to the royal palace on foot, remained in the presence of his father for an hour, saw Vilāsavatī, &c.
