The Indeclinable Past Participles are of the nature of gerunds. They fall under two heads:—(1) Those derived by affixing @deva[क्त्वा] to the simple root, and (2) Those derived by means of @deva[य] affixed to the root compounded with prepositions or words used prepositionally; @deva[गम्]—@deva[गत्वा] 'having gone,' @deva[भू] with @deva[परि]—@deva[परिभूय] 'having' 'having served;' &c.
