## Special Forms of आन Participles

### (a) Change to इ

The @deva[आ] of @deva[आन] is changed to @deva[इ] in the case of the root @deva[आस्] (2 cl.) 'to sit':

Present Participle: @deva[आसीन]

### (b) Formation of Nouns

@deva[आन] added to the roots @deva[यु] and @deva[यज्] forms nouns:

@deva[पवमानः] 'that which purifies, hence, the wind' (cf. Rāg. VIII. 9); also, 'one of the sacred fires'

@deva[यजमानः] 'one who sacrifices'
