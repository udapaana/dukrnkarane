The past passive participle active and passive, may be used with the auxiliaries @deva[अस्] and @deva[भू] in any tense, the meaning of the participle changing accordingly; @deva[गतोऽस्मि] I have or am starting; I have or am gone; so @deva[गतवानभवम्] or @deva[गतवानासम्] or @deva[गतोभूवम्] I had or was gone; @deva[इत्यादि]. @deva[गतो वनं भविष्यति रामः श्वः] that Rāma is to go to the forest to-morrow; @deva[संबभूवः कीर्तिमहत्त्वं भविष्यति] thou wilt obtain great glory, &c.
