## Ablative with Fear and Protection

In the case of words expressing fear or protection from fear, that from which or whom the fear proceeds is put in the Ablative case; @deva[चोरात् भेति] is afraid of a thief; @deva[भीता रणे न त्रायते] is not afraid of the white-horned one i.e. Arjuna; @deva[सदास्यस्यरु यरोयु वापनं महत्तो यभायु] (Bhag. II. 40) even a little of this (kind of) piety saves one from great fear; @deva[कपेरच्छिष्यनुवात्] (Bhaṭṭi IX. 11.) were afraid of the roar of the monkey.

(a) That from which one is kept off is also put in the Ablative; @deva[पापात् विवारयति] wards off from sin; @deva[यवरुथात् गां वारयति] keeps off the cow from barley.[^1]
