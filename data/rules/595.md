## Perfect Forms in Passive Voice

### (a) Reduplicative Perfect

The Reduplicative Perfect of a root in the Passive is formed like that of the Active, except in that the Auxiliary verb @deva[भू] is used instead of @deva[अस्].

**Example:**
@deva[क्रीयते]—@deva[क्रीयां बभूव] &c.

### (b) Periphrastic Perfect

The Periphrastic Perfect of the Passive does not differ from that of the Active, except in that the Auxiliary verb @deva[भू]—@deva[चकार] is used.

**Examples:**
- @deva[क्रीयते]—@deva[क्रीयां चकार]
- @deva[पूज्यते]—@deva[पूजां चकार]

And before it @deva[इस्] is used.
