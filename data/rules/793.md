## Pronoun Agreement with Nouns

(a) When a pronoun is used relatively with its noun, it must agree with it in gender and number; @deva[यः पुरुषः स गच्छति] that man goes, @deva[या स्त्री सा गच्छति] that woman goes, @deva[यत् फलं तत् फलम्] that fruit, &c.

(b) When the nouns are of different genders, the pronoun is put in the masculine when they are masculine and feminine, and in the neuter when they are masculine, feminine and neuter.

**Concord of the Relative with the Antecedent.**
