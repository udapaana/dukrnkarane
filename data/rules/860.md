## Genitive with Words of Equality/Likeness

In the case of words denoting equality or likeness, such as @deva[तुल्य], @deva[सदृश], &c., the person or thing with whom or which any object is compared is put in the Genitive case, except in the case of @deva[तुल्य] there is no compulsion; @deva[कृष्णस्य कृष्णस्य वा] equal to or like Kṛṣṇa; @deva[कोऽन्योऽस्ति सदृशो मम] who else is equal to me? but @deva[छायास्य तुल्यो उपमा वा नारिंगु] (Sid. Kau.)[^1]

Obs.—The words @deva[तुल्य] and @deva[उपमा], however, are found used by good authors with the Instrumental against Pāṇini's rule; @deva[तुल्यो वर्षेण वनवासम्] (Kum. V. 34.) which rises to the high position of being equal with your lip; @deva[स्तनाबर्धं अतिरुक्तनं शम्भुना] (Siṣ. I. 4.) clearly deserving to be compared with Śambhu white with ashes; see Rag. VIII. 15.
