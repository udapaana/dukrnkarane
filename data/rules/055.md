There are eight cases in each number:—Nominative (Nom. or N.), Vocative (Voc. or V.), Accusative (Acc. or A.) Instrumental (Ins. or I.), Dative (Dat. or D.), Ablative (Abl. or Ab.), Genitive (Gen. or G.), and Locative (Loc or L.). These express nearly all relations between words in a sentence.

**N. B.** These genders, numbers and cases will, for the sake of convenience, be denoted by their abbreviations enclosed into brackets after each.
