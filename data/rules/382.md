The first six lakāras are to be distinguished into two groups, the Special or Conjugational (@deva[विकरण]) or general. In the former the characteristic marks and terminations of each are mostly added to a special base formed from the roots in various ways, while in the latter they are combined with the root itself.[^1]

**(a)** The base (@deva[अङ्ग]) of a root is that form which it assumes before the personal terminations.

[^1]: Strictly the term Sārvadhātuka (belonging to the whole of a root) is given by Pāṇini to the terminations of all tenses in Parasmaipada as opposed to Ātmanepada; also, to the Imperative, the Benedictive, and to the affixes distinguished by @deva[छ] or @deva[श्] denoting agency (kṛt): thus various conjugational signs of the Lakāras (i. e. except that of the @deva[लृट्-लिङ्]), and the terminations of the Present Participle, etc., all in the Ātmanepada terminations are called Sārvadhātuka. Derivative moods and tenses as the Derivative verbs, and its various conjugations, see sūtra of @ref[385] to form the several bases, and a few denominatives, the affixes @deva[झय्], @deva[छु] etc. The other conjugational signs of the lakāras (i. e. the @deva[लृङ्-लिङ्] and the @deva[शतृ], and the Passive and the Frequentative conjugations) and the signs @deva[क्त], @deva[क्त्वा], and other affixes which show that they must be followed by Ātmanepada terminations; also, others are called Ardhadhātuka, the remaining Non-Conjugational (@deva[सकारान्त]).
