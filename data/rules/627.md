## Two Types of Frequentative Bases

There are two kinds of Frequentative bases derived from roots; both are formed by a peculiar reduplication of the root:

1. **Ātmanepada Frequentative**: The suffix @deva[य] (@deva[यङ्]) is added to the root before reduplication takes place, and the base is conjugated in the Ātmanepada alone.

2. **Parasmaipada Frequentative**: The suffix @deva[य] is dropped (@deva[यङलुङ्]) and the base is conjugated in Parasmaipada only (in the Ātmanepada also, according to some grammarians).

It will be convenient to call one the Ātm. Frequentative, and the other the Parasm. Frequentative.
