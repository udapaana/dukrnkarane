A Dwandwa compound consists of two or more nouns which, if not compounded, would be connected by the copulative particle @deva[च] (and),[^1] as @deva[राजदेवौ] which is equal to @deva[राजश्च देवश्च]; @deva[पाणिपादौ] which is the same as @deva[पाणी च पादौ च]. There are three species of the Dwandwa; viz. @deva[इतरेतरद्वन्द्व], @deva[समाहारद्वन्द्व] and @deva[एकशेष].[^2]

[^1]: @deva[चार्थे द्वन्द्वः ।] Pāṇ. II. 2. 22.

[^2]: The Ekasesha is not strictly speaking a subdivision of Dwandwa. It is a separate Vṛitti by itself (Vide @ref[179]). Sanskrit grammarians do not regard it as a Dwandwa, though it may be so regarded for the sake of convenience. 'It is not a Dwandwa,' remarks Bhattoji Dikshita, 'as it does not contain more than one subanta (@deva[अनेकसुबन्ताभावादद्वन्द्वः]).' It should be further remembered that since it is not a samāsa, its final vowel does not become udātta, as in the case of a Dwandwa compound.
