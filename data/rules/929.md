[^1] The Perfect denotes an action done before the current day and not witnessed by the speaker. It has reference to a very remote time and should, therefore, be used in narrating events of the remote past; @deva[तां ताटकानामकां निजघान रामः।] Rāma killed her whose name was Tātakā. @deva[प्रपादविन्दट्युच्यतम्] (Bhattṛi. XIV.16.).

(a) In the 1st person the Perfect shows that the speaker was in a distracted state of mind or was unconscious when the event took place, or that he wants to say too story of something he has done, @deva[बहु जल्पाट् पुरस्तस्य प्राक्तं च स्मृहम्] (S'is XI. 30) being frenzied I prattled much, I am told, before him; @deva[कलिङ्गनगरेऽस्तः किम्]। didst thou dwell in the country of the Kalingas? @deva[न वै कलिङ्गनगरं जगाम] I never went to Kalinga; With these exceptions the Perfect should not be used in the 1st person.
