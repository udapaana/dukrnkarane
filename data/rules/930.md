[^1] The Aorist simply expresses past action indefinitely i. e. without reference to any particular time (@deva[भूतमात्रे लुङ्]); @deva[अधीष्ट चैकलिङ्गाणां विद्यामतिसुतुम् बन्धून्। यजे यद्वेदैरास्तां पितॄन् पृथग्जनोचितम्] (Bhatt. I. 2.) 'He studied the Vedas, offered sacrifices to the gods, satisfied his departed ancestors, honoured his relatives, subdued the collection of six (i. e. the six passions), took delight in politics and totally annihilated his enemies.' The Aorist, however, properly denotes immediate action or one done during the course of the present day. "It is similar to the English present Perfect," remarks Dr. Bhāṇḍārkar[^2], "which the student will remember defines an action as having happened in a portion of time which is not yet expired; it brings past action in connection with the present time," @deva[अद्यावर्षीत्] it rained to-day.

[^1]: @deva[लुङ्] Pāṇ. III. 2. 110.

[^2]: See note under @ref[925].
