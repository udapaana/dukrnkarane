## Genitive Subjective and Objective with Kṛidantas

The Genitive is used subjectively and objectively with Kṛidantas or Primary Nominal Bases derived by means of the Kṛit affixes (i. e. is used in the sense of the subject or the object of the action denoted by the Kṛidantas); @deva[कृष्णस्य गतिः] an act of Kṛṣṇa i. e. of which Kṛṣṇa is the agent; @deva[जगतः कर्त्तृ] the Creator of the world, which is the object of the action denoted by the noun @deva[कर्त्तृ]; similarly @deva[सतां पालकः] the protector of the good; @deva[यवस्य वरं] will be the similies of mṛiti; @deva[मद्कवेः किंनुम्] a work of that poet; @deva[सारस्य दुहितरं न भाट्.] (Rāmacharita XII. 117.) This is not a common creation of Brahman.[^1]

(a) In the case of verbs governing two Accusatives the secondary object of the Kṛidanta may be put in the Genitive or in the Accusative; @deva[नैतस्य द्वितीयं दास्यस्य वा] (Sid. Kau.) the taker of the horse to Śrughna.

(b) When the agent and the object of the bases derived by means of Kṛit affixes are used in a sentence, the object is put in the Genitive case and not the agent. @deva[गवां गोपा वैष्णविकरणम्] the milking of cows by one who is not a cowherd is a wonder.

Exceptions.—This rule does not apply to Kṛit nouns ending in the affixes @deva[अनक] and @deva[अ] when feminine; @deva[विश्वस्यस्य भेदिका वा वरस्य जगतः] (Sid. Kau.) the desire of Rudra to split the universe or the splitting of the universe by Rudra. According to some when the Kṛit affix is @deva[घञ्], i. e. of feminine gender, and according to others...[^2]
