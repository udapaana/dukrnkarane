## Ablative with अन्य, पर and Direction Words

The words @deva[अन्य], @deva[पर] and others having a similar sense, or words expressive of direction used with reference to time or place, are construed with the Ablative; @deva[परि तस्मात् पुण्यं तस्य] (Kir. XIV. 34.); see also @deva[गङ्गायाः अन्य गोदावरि] (Kir. II. 108). If @deva[अन्य] or @deva[पर] is used to express 'beyond (or apart from) the limits of,' a sense of separating or beyond the limit meaning, it may be used with the Ablative.[^1]
