The infinitive in Sanskrit has no passive form. In turning, therefore, an active construction involving an infinitive into a passive one, the verb should be changed into the passive, the infinitive and the words governed by it remaining unaffected—e. g. @deva[सोऽमुं पुरं गन्तुमिष्टः], @deva[तेन पुरं गन्तुं द्यच्यते]—except where the object of the infinitive and the verb is the same, @deva[स पारं सोढुमिच्छति], @deva[तेन पारं सोढुमिष्यते].
