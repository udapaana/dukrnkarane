@deva[सह] forming the first member of a compound, is changed to @deva[स]—[^1]

**(a)** when the whole compound is a name, e. g. @deva[सभाजयः]; but @deva[सहयुध्वा] a comrade in battle ( Upapada comp. ).

**(b)** when it means 'including a certain literary work,' or 'in addition to;' as @deva[सज्योतिषम्] ( Avya. comp. ) @deva[ज्योतिषमधीते] 'he studies the science of astronomy, including that of finding out the auspicious times,' @deva[सकोणा वीणा] 'a khāri with a drone in addition to it.'

**(c)** and when the object denoted by the latter member is not visibly seen, but is to be inferred: as @deva[सराक्षश्चा] ( Bah-comp. ) @deva[निशा] 'a night in which presence of demoness is to be inferred'
