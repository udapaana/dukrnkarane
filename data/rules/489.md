## Reduplicative Perfect Formation

The Reduplicative Perfect is formed of all monosyllabic roots beginning with consonants, as well as of those beginning with the vowels @deva[अ] or @deva[आ], and @deva[ऋ], @deva[ऌ]; and @deva[ए] short.

Exceptions—@deva[ऊह्], @deva[अस्], @deva[कास्], @deva[आस्]. These take the Periphrastic Perfect necessarily.
