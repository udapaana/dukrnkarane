## Verb Agreement with Subjects of Different Persons

(a) When a verb agrees with two or more subjects of different persons connected by 'and,' the first person has preference over the second or third, and the second over the third; @deva[त्वमहं रामश्चैव गच्छामः] Rāma, you and I shall do this; @deva[त्वं रामश्च पश्चिमालां गच्छतः].

(b) But when the subjects are connected by 'or', the verb agrees with the one nearest to it @deva[स वा वयं वा तत्स्वीकुर्विष्यामः] he or we accomplish that; @deva[अहं रामोऽभवा राजा लक्षस्यागो वा धरिष्यति] either I or King Rāma or Lakṣmaṇa will perish.
