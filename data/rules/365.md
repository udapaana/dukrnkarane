## Definition and Function of Prepositions (Upasarga)

A preposition, styled 'Upasarga or Gati,' in Sanskrit is an indeclinable word, having an independent meaning and prefixed to verbs and also to their derivatives. These prepositions modify, intensify and sometimes totally alter the senses of roots[^1]:

### Examples

- @deva[प्रहृ] 'to strike'
- @deva[आहृ] 'to eat, to perform as a sacrifice'
- @deva[संहृ] 'to contract'
- @deva[विहृ] 'to sport'
- @deva[परिहृ] 'to avoid', &c.

Sometimes they are prefixed without any alteration in the sense.

[^1]: @deva[धात्वर्थं भावयते कञ्चित्कञ्चिन्नानुवर्तते । तस्मै विहितस्तस्य उपसर्गागतिविक्रिया] Cf. also Sid. Kau. @deva[उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थो बलादन्यत्र नीयते । प्रहाराहारसंहारविहारपरिहारवत्] Some think that prepositions have no meaning of their own, but they simply bring to light when prefixed to roots their hidden senses (cf. Śiś. X.15).
