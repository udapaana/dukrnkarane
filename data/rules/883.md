@deva[भवत्] is used in the second person like 'you' in English as a courteous form of address though it is to be regarded as a pronoun of the third person and ought to be treated as such, even as @deva[युष्मद्] &c.; @deva[भवत्] is used in the sacred texts; @deva[भवान् अपि तत्र गच्छतु] you may also go there.

(a) When respect is to be shown, @deva[अत्र] and @deva[तत्र] are prefixed to @deva[भवत्] according as the person with reference to whom it is used is near, or at a distance or absent; @deva[अत्रभवान् काश्यपः] the venerable Kāshyapa (who is near); @deva[इदमासनं अलङ्कारित्वान्तत्रभवान्] may you. occupy (lit. ornament) this seat; @deva[तत्रभवतो द्रावती] lady Irāvatī (who is not present); sometimes @deva[सः] is used with @deva[भवत्] to show respect; as @deva[यद्यस्य विषये विषये सः भवान् निवसति।] Māl. Mād. I.
