## Conjugation of Causal Base Like Tenth Class

The Causal base is conjugated like the base of a root of the 10th or Churādi class in all the ten Tenses and Moods of the Parasmaipada, the Ātmanepada and the Passive.

The @deva[अय्] (i. e. @deva[अय्] with the final @deva[अ] dropped) is retained, as remarked before, in the General Tenses, except the Aorist and the Benedictive, and is dropped before the @deva[य] of the Passive.

The formation of the Aorist of causals has been fully explained along with that of the roots of the Tenth class, at @ref[548]-@ref[556].
