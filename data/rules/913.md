[^1] The infinitive is used with verbs and verbal nouns meaning 'to wish or desire' provided the agent of it is the same as that of the verb; @deva[को मृगयच्छति हरेः दशनम्] (Mṛid. I.) who wishes to snatch away the jaws of the lion; @deva[मायिनां यदविकतुं श्रद्धां पृथग्जनोच्चित] Bhattṛi. II. 6. But @deva[तेषां तदकर्तुमिच्छामि] I wish him to do this, is wrong.

[^1]: @deva[समानकर्तृकेषु तुमुन्] Pāṇ. III. 3. 158.
