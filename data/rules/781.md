## Concord: Agreement of Words in Sentences

Concord is the agreement of words in a sentence as regards gender, number, person or tense.

The concords deserving notice in Sanskrit are three:—(1) Concord of the verb with the Subject; (2) Concord of the Adjective with the Substantive; and (3) Concord of the Relative with its Antecedent.

**CONCORD OF THE VERB WITH THE SUBJECT.**
