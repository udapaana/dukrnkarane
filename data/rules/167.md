@deva[ऊनविंशति], @deva[विंशति] and other cardinal numbers up to @deva[नवनवति] are all feminine substantives, the numerals @deva[शत], @deva[सहस्र], &c. are all neuter, with the exception of @deva[लक्ष] which is neu. and fem. @deva[कोटि] which is fem. and @deva[शङ्ख] and @deva[जलधि] both of which are mas. and have no declensional peculiarities. They are declined in the sing. and so used with a plural noun; e. g. @deva[पञ्चविंशतिब्राह्मणाः:] 25 Brāhmaṇas; @deva[एकादशाधिकशतेन] or @deva[एका-दशोत्तरेण शतेन नरैः] or @deva[स्त्रीभिः:] by 111 men or women; @deva[एकोनसहस्रेण रूप्यकैः:] with Rs. 999 &c. They may be made to have duals and plurals by being used as fixed standards of counting; e. g. @deva[ब्राह्मणानां विंशतयः:] many twenties of Brāhmaṇas; @deva[द्वे शते नारीणाम्] two hundreds of women &c.
