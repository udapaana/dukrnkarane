In the following list are alphabetically arranged almost all the common Kṛt affixes forming nouns (substantive and adjective) with various significations from roots or derivative bases. @deva[अ]—(@deva[अच्], @deva[अण्], @deva[अय्], @deva[कुत्व], @deva[रच्], @deva[रव]; @deva[खच्], @deva[घञ्], @deva[यु], @deva[ड], @deva[डु], @deva[यू], and @deva[व]):—

**Note:** This rule contains extensive detailed listings of Kṛt affixes with their formations, meanings, and examples. Due to the OCR corruption in the raw text, a comprehensive cleaned version would require careful reconstruction of each affix entry. The rule serves as a reference compendium covering:

- Affix @deva[अ] and its variants in various senses (agent, action, instrument, place)
- Affixes @deva[इ], @deva[उ], @deva[ए], @deva[क], @deva[त], @deva[तृ], @deva[न], @deva[म], @deva[य], @deva[र], @deva[व], @deva[ष]
- Formation rules for each affix
- Specific root combinations and their resulting forms
- Semantic categories (agent nouns, action nouns, instrumental nouns, abstract nouns)
- Special exceptions and alternative forms
- Examples from classical usage

This comprehensive reference section spans pages 449-458 and serves as the primary resource for understanding Kṛt affix formations in Sanskrit grammar.
