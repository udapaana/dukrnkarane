(2) Roots ending in @deva[ऋ] preceded by a conjunct consonant may take Fourth or Fifth Form in the Ātmanepada.

(3) @deva[भञ्ज्] and @deva[घ्] Par. take the Fifth Form only. @deva[घ्] Â. may take the Fourth or the Fifth Form.

(4) Of Seṭ roots @deva[इ] and those ending in @deva[ऋ] (long) when Ātm. belong to either (4th or 5th Variety). @deva[प्रच्छ्] and @deva[कृष्] when Â. belong to the Fourth.
