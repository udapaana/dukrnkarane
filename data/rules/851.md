## Genitive with Verbs of Affliction (Disease)

Verbs meaning 'to be afflicted with a disease' govern the Genitive of their object when used impersonally or when they have for their subject names of diseases; @deva[चोरस्य ज्वरेण रुज्यते] the thief is afflicted with the pain of fever; @deva[दुःखस्य रुज्यते] coryza; bilious pain on the man; except when @deva[ज्वर] and @deva[संताप] are used as subjects; (vide Bhaṭṭi. VIII. 120;) @deva[तं रुजति ज्वरः] or @deva[संतापः] fever or affliction pains him.[^1]
