## Second Aorist Variety: Parasmaipada and Exceptions

This Variety is Parasmaipadā with a few exceptions such as @deva[ऋ] with @deva[सम्], @deva[स्था], @deva[वच्], and @deva[अस्] 'to throw' with a preposition. The roots @deva[लिण्], @deva[सिच्], and @deva[हे] take this form in the Par. and optionally in the Ātm, in which they also take the Fourth Form.
