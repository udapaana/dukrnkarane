The Present tense shows that an action is taking place at the present time; @deva[अयमागच्छति तव पुत्रः] here comes (is coming) thy son. [^1] It is the Present progressive, which expresses the continuance of an action which is begun over sometime and is, remarks Prof. Bain, a true or strict Present tense. It is only by means of a special adverb or the context that the sense of the present tense can be limited to that of a present act solely; @deva[अद्य स इह पुरे वसति] now he dwells in this city.

[^1]: "The principal use of the Present Indefinite is to express what is true at all times; 'the sun gives light; twice two is four * * *.' Hence a more suitable name would be the Universal tense. It expresses present time only as representing all time. The permanent arrangements and laws of nature, the peculiarities, habits and properties of living beings and whatever is constant, regular and uniform, have to be represented by the Present Indefinite. * * It is only by a special adverb or by the context that we can confine this tense to mean a present act only." Bain, Higher English Grammar.
