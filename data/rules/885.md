The pronouns @deva[एक] and @deva[अपर] or @deva[अन्य] are used in the plural in the sense of 'some—others;' @deva[विधवापुनर्विवाहः साध्वीकृतः इति एके शास्त्रिभिः उच्यन्ते अपरैस्तद्धनिषिद्धं उच्यते अन्यैश्च कलौ निरुद्धः ताभ्याम्] some think that widow-remarriage is sanctioned by the Ś'astras, some say that it is prohibited by them, while others hold that it was allowed in the Kali age. @deva[कोऽपि] may take the place of @deva[एके].
