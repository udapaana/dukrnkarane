# A Higher Sanskrit Grammar

**Author:** @deva[महादेव रामकृष्ण काले] (@[Mahādeva Rāmakṛṣṇa Kāle])

**Original Publication:** 1894

---

This digital edition presents the complete text of _A Higher Sanskrit Grammar_ by M.R. Kale, a comprehensive treatise on Sanskrit grammar that has served generations of students and scholars since its first publication in 1894.

It is the best available grammar of the Sanskrit language in English written by a native grammarian. As such we hope to start with this work as a foundation for a more comprehensive modern grammar for the Sanskrit language that aspires to supercede the extant references (i.e. Macdonell, Whitney, etc.).

Those works are undoubtedly important to the modern English-speaking student of sanskrit, but they suffer from the 19th century condecension of their authors' era. One can recognize the monumental work of Whitney and Macdonell, but we hope to be able to remedy this by writing a modern grammar without the same flaws-- perhaps with flaws all our own. Please contribute to the project if you find such an error.
