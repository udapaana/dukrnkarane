## Genitive Case Introduction and Relation (संबन्ध)

The words @deva[अन्तिकात्] and others having the same sense, are used in the Ablative, the Accusative and the Instrumental cases; @deva[ग्रामस्य दूरात् दूरं दूरेण वा] away from the village; so @deva[अन्तकात् अन्तिकं अन्तिकेन वा] near the village.

## THE GENITIVE CASE

The Genitive, as already remarked, is not a Kāraka case. It, therefore, expresses simply the relation of one noun to the other in a sentence; e.g. that of servant and his master (a relation which is other than that expressed by a Kāraka case); @deva[रात्रो पुरुषः मातुः प्रियस्य सुणः] &c.; and even in those cases where the genitive is used in the sense of other cases it expresses simple relation or @deva[संबन्ध] only.
