## Five Mātrā Gaṇas

In the case of metres regulated by syllabic instants each line is divided into groups of four mātrās called the Mātrā Gaṇas; one @deva[मात्रा] or instant is allotted to a short vowel and two to a long one. The Mātrā gaṇas are five in number. These may be symbolically represented thus:[^1]

| Mātrā Gaṇa | Pattern |
|------------|---------|
| @deva[म] | — — |
| @deva[न] | ∪ — — |
| @deva[भ] | ∪ ∪ ∪ ∪ |
| @deva[स] | ∪ ∪ — |
| @deva[त] | ∪ — ∪ |
