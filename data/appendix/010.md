## Twenty-Six Classes of Samavṛttas

There are 26 classes of Samavṛttas or regular metres generally accepted. This classification rests on the number of syllables in each quarter which may vary from one to twenty-six. Each of these classes comprises a variety of metres all differing from one another according to the combination of the various gaṇas.
