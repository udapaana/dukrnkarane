## Structure of a Stanza: Pāda, Syllable, and Mātrā

A @deva[पद्य] or stanza consists of four lines each called a pāda or quarter. A pāda is regulated either by the number of syllables (@deva[अक्षर]) or by the number of syllabic instants (@deva[मात्रा]).

### (a) Definition of Syllable

A syllable is as much of a word as can be uttered distinctly by one effort of the voice[^1], i.e. a single vowel with or without one or more consonants.

### (b) Definition of Mātrā

A mātrā (@deva[मात्रा]) is the measure of time required to pronounce a short vowel.

[^1]: @deva[वर्णानामुच्चारणं च मात्रानं च तद्गुणश्च्यते वर्णस्यारम्भनम्] Daṇḍin Kāv. Pr. I.
