## Eight Gaṇas (Syllabic Feet)

In the case of metres regulated by syllables each line is divided by groups of three syllables called gaṇas or syllabic feet, named as @deva[म], @deva[य], @deva[र], @deva[स]; @deva[त], @deva[ज], @deva[भ], and @deva[न]. The names and the Schemes of these are given in the following stanza.[^1]

### Mnemonic Verse

The verse describes each gaṇa:

- @deva[म] (ma) has all its syllables long
- @deva[य] (ya) has all its syllables short
- @deva[भ] (bha) has its first syllable long
- @deva[य] (ya) has its first syllable short
- @deva[ज] (ja) has its middle syllable long
- @deva[र] (ra) has its middle syllable short
- @deva[स] (sa) has its last syllable long
- @deva[त] (ta) has its last syllable short[^2]

### Symbolic Notation

The symbol ∪ stands for a short or light syllable; the symbol — denotes a long vowel or a heavy syllable. Symbolically represented these Gaṇas will stand as under:

| Gaṇa | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| @deva[म] | — — — |
| @deva[य] | ∪ ∪ ∪ |
| @deva[भ] | — ∪ ∪ |
| @deva[य] | ∪ — — |
| @deva[ज] | ∪ — — |
| @deva[र] | — ∪ — |
| @deva[स] | ∪ ∪ — |
| @deva[त] | — — ∪ |

Similarly the letter @deva[ल] (la) is used to denote a short syllable and @deva[ग] (ga) a long one at the close of a line.

[^2]: The above verse is easier to remember than one given above; @deva[आदिमध्यान्तगुर्वीणां भजसा गुर्वो मताः । लघुमध्यास्त्रयश्चैते यरता लोकगः स्मृताः]
