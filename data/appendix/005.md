## Treatment of Final Syllable in a Pāda

The last syllable of a pāda is either heavy or light according as the exigence of the metre requires it, whatever be its natural length;[^1] as in examples from Vikramorvaśī and Raghuvamśa.

[^1]: Vide Vṛttaratnākara I. 3.

### Note on Prosody Sources

The earliest writer on Prosody is Piṅgalācārya. His work is known as "The Piṅgalachhandaḥ-śāstra." It is written in Sūtras and is divided into eight books. The Agni Purāṇa also deals with the subject very fully. The present chapter, however, is chiefly based on the Vṛttaratnākara and Chandomanjarī.
