## Vṛtta and Jāti: Two Types of Metrical Stanzas

A pāda or stanza may be either a @deva[वृत्त] or a @deva[जाति].

### (a) Vṛtta

A Vṛtta is a stanza the metre of which is regulated by the number and position of syllables in each pāda or quarter.

### (b) Jāti

A Jāti is a stanza the metre of which is regulated by the number of syllabic instants in each Pāda or quarter.
