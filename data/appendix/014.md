## Jāti: Metres Regulated by Syllabic Instants

The most common variety of metres regulated by syllabic instants is @deva[आर्या]. It is of nine kinds:[^1]

@deva[पथा वियुला चपला मुखचपला जयमयचपला च ।]
@deva[गीत्युपगीत्युद्वुरीतय आर्योभीतिद्यु नवश्रयाः॥]

Of these the last four are generally used and described here.

The first and third quarters of this metre should contain fourteen syllabic instants and the second and fourth sixteen each; of these:

1. The last eight mātrās should consist of a र-gaṇa (—∪—) followed by a short and a long syllable (∪—)
2. The syllabic instants in the even quarters should not be at all composed of short syllables or long syllables
3. The even syllabic instant in each quarter (i.e. the 2nd, 4th and 8th) should not be formed conjointly with the next (i.e. 3rd, 5th and 9th)

| Quarter | Mātrās | Final Pattern |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1st | 14 | र + ल + ग (—∪— ∪—) |

## @deva[आर्योपच्छन्दसिक] (Āryopacchandasika)

### Definition

@deva[पर्यैन्तैयौ तथैव शेषमोपच्छैन्दुसिकं सुधाभिरुरुकम्]

### Structure

| Quarter | Mātrās | Final Pattern |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1st | 15 | र + ग (—∪— —) |
| 2nd | 17 | र + ग (—∪— —) |
